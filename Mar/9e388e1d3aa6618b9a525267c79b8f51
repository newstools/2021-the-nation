The other players are Faith Keya who is a student at Gatero Girls and Mildred Anjelina from Nyuki Starlets. 

"My focus is to steer Nakuru Queens to win the Sh1million prize money and represent Kenya in the CECAFA Women's Championship," said Nasimiyu, who was in the national women's under-20 football team that played Ghana's the Junior Black Queens in the second round of the 2018 Fifa Under-20 Women's World Cup in November 2017 where Kenya was thumped 5-0 in Accra and in the return match in Nairobi, they lost 5-1. 






"I want to achieve my football goals at Nakuru Queens by ensuring their win the FKF Women Premier League title and play for Harambee Starlets," said the 20-year-old Andisi, who is a huge fan of English Premier League giants Manchester United. 

Winger Ingaitsa, 23, joins Nakuru Queens from Division One side Sunderland Samba from Nairobi and is ready to prove herself in the team. 

"I want to show the team management that they did not make a mistake. I want to shine in the remaining six matches and help the team win the Zone B," said Ingaitsa, who is a great fan of Barcelona's Lionel Messi. 

Coach George Aloise said the recruitment will strengthen the weak departments in the team. 

"We identified our weak points in the first leg and I hope the new players will boost the side in the remaining matches," said Aloise.
