Earlier in the day, Paschal Mayunga, Assistant Inspector of Immigration in the district, alleged that on March 9, 2021, they received a report of the appearance of non-Tanzanians in the Usseri and arrested them and handed them over to the police. 

Pleaded guilty 

He said after being brought to court the 26 confessed to committing the offense, "since all the accused have pleaded guilty to the offense and the court convicts all of them for the offense they were charged with." 






"So for committing the crime the court sentenced them to one year in jail or a fine of TSh500,000 (ShSh23,600) each." 

It was not clear whether the 26 raised the fine or were taken to jail. Chief government spokesman says translation will be completed by December 2021.
