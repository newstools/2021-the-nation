“Go out and conquer,” Kioni told the team. 

“We believe and have faith that you can do it. We want to see you back at the Olympic Games.” 

Kioni said that they will endeavour to support minor sports in every facet since they believe they are capable of securing medals for Kenya at the Olympics away from athletics. 

“I am delighted to note that the team also has a female firer, which is encouraging...we need to have more,” said Kioni, who is also the chef de mission for Team Kenya for the Tokyo Olympic Games. 

“I am doing fairly well considering that I am barely a year old in competitive Air rifle,” said Wangui, the only lady in the team for the India event.  

It won’t be the first time Wangui is representing Kenya, having taken part at the African championships in 2019, where she attained her first minimum qualifying score (MQS) of 590 points. 

“The best is yet to come,” said a confident Wangui, adding that she not only wants to make it to Tokyo, but also win a medal.  

At the same time, a team of five firers who will compete at the Bollard Shooting Championships due March 26-27 in South Africa, also received the national flag. 

Tony Karanja, Mwangi Gikonyo, Peter Njoroge, Sammy Onyango and Ibrahim Ndugu will be using the event to prepare for the national trials for the World IPSC Championships due November in the United Kingdom.
