"We needed to win against KDF to boost our chances of qualifying for the last four and I'm glad the players rose to the occasion. We have two matches remaining against Pipeline and Kenya Prisons and those are tough matches but we will give our best," said Bor. 

KDF coach Pius Birech said qualifying for the play-offs will be a tall order. 

Birech admitted that the remaining matches against leaders Prisons, Pipeline and Nairobi Prisons will be tough thus losing to KDF complicated their chances.  

"It will not be easy but in sports anything is possible. We will push to the last minute and see what happens," said Birech. 

Pipeline coach Paul Gitau said: "I'm impressed with the confidence the players are oozing. I have a young squad that has been improving each and every match. For now is to ensure we qualify for the play-offs and I believe we are on the right track."  

Prisons coach Josp Barasa said they are out to qualify for the play-offs unbeaten. Norway is among the countries said to be influencing Somalia in its pursuit of the matter. He expressed hope for President Hassan's success, noting she had been serving as Vice President. Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior is the last South Sudan Vice President to contract Covid-19.
