Minors aged 10 years are abusing drugs at the Coast, the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) has warned.Nacada decried over rampant drug abuse among children from age 10. 

However, the authority said the availability of drugs and irresponsibility parenting had led to the rise of the vice.

Last week, security agencies led by a multi-agency team launched a massive 14-day rapid results initiative to smoke out drug barons, peddlers and sellers of illicit brew owing to the rise of the vice that has ensnared minors at the port city. 

“Our survey shows those adversely affected by drug addiction are aged between 15 to 40. However, we have realized that children from as young as 10 years are abusing drugs, these are minors and it is scary. Let’s not point fingers. 

But the minors are abusing drugs because it is easily available and parents are no longer taking their parental responsibilities,” said Nacada Coast chairman Mr George Karisa.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




Mr Karisa accused parents of failing to take their responsibilities leaving their children to be parented by teachers. He said Nacada has a responsibility to reverse the trend. 

“Our children have lost direction. Some parents are also abusing drugs in the full glare of their children. The minors after seeing their parents abusing drugs start experimenting,” he insisted. 

The Nacada boss warned that the port city is on the verge of losing control of the situation that has consumed the most productive generation of the youth between the ages of 15 and 40 years.

Anti-drug activist, Reachout Centre Trust Executive Director Taib Abdulrahman urged Kenyans to remedy the situation by early detection and take their minors to rehabilitation centres. 

Reachout Centre Trust is a rehabilitation centre rescuing and rehabilitating drug addicts in the region. 

“We are rehabilitating children from the age of 12 to 13 years old who are abusing drugs. The situation is bad in Coast region. If we don’t take care, in the next two to three years they will venture into drugs,” said Mr Abdulrahman.
