"The attackers did not open fire even though they were heavily armed. They laid an ambush, stopped the convoy and snatched some items from the commissioner and his driver. After letting them go, they started throwing stones. It was then that Mr Odidi was injured," Mr Jaldesa told the Nation. 

“There is a growing concern about increasing cases of highway banditry,” he also said, but added that officers from the Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU), the General Service Unit (GSU), Administration Police (AP) and the Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) were deployed to the troubled area to beef up security.
