What happened 

The gunman, who wore a blue hooded jacket and gloves, attacked the officer from behind and pushed him to the ground. 

In the struggle that ensued, he managed to take the officer’s semi-automatic Ceska pistol from his waistband, chamber a cartridge and shoot him in the pelvic area. The bullet exited through the stomach. 






He then started shooting indiscriminately at people who were fleeing in different directions. 

A police officer attached to Bus Park cautiously followed the attacker, grabbed him from the back and, with the help of members of the public, subdued him and pinned him to the ground. 

He did not manage to arrest him as irate members of the public used stones and other crude weapons to kill him.

Body unclaimed 

The attacker’s images, which were captured during the incident on March 5, were widely circulated and members of the public ask to give police information that can help identify him, by calling 0800 722 203. 

“Preliminary forensic investigations indicate that the assailant’s details cannot be [found] in government records. The three identity cards that were found in his possession belong to other individuals who have since been identified,” the DCI said on its official Twitter page.

The detectives said they will carry on with investigations to identify him and members of a possible criminal network.
