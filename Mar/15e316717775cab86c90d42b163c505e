The government was forced to change tack in how it handles the public mourning ceremonies after the chaos that was witnessed in Dar es Salaam. Thousands of people thronged Uhuru Stadium to pay their last respects to Magufuli but in the process, chaos erupted after some mourners forced their way into the venue. 

It was in that process that the Mtuwa family from Kimara Mwisho, Dar es Salaam ended up losing its kin in a stampede.  They were killed in chaos that erupted at Uhuru Stadium as Tanzanians paid their last respects to President John Magufuli. The procedure for the funeral of the late President John Magufuli has changed after the chaos that happened at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
