Rware beat Kibra Woodley 1-0 last Sunday after their 2-1 loss in their match against Dagoretti Lion FC at Ruring’u Stadium two weeks ago. 

According to Rware chairman Emmanuel Matano, the team’s technical bench have corrected previous mistakes and should come up with good results. 

“We have been training harder on our speed and ball work. We train from Tuesday to Saturday both morning and evening sessions,” he said. 

“In our club, we don’t have the “best” players and the line-up is determined during the week because there is an internal competition for the first 18 slots, so it is hard to say who is the best player now or who will automatically walk into the starting 11,” he added.
