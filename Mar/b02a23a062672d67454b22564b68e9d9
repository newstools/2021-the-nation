He said he presented himself to the DCI after receiving reports that he was being sought by police.

But police sources revealed the MP was in his vehicle when his team was arrested on Friday, but managed to escape on foot, leaving his phone behind. 

"He has been in hiding since Thursday. His bodyguard was disarmed after being arrested, " said a source privy to the investigations. 

Mr Nyakeramba lost in the mini-poll, only managing position six out of the 11 candidates.

"He damaged the windscreen, windows and the doors valued at Sh200, 000, the property of Peter Karanja Njuguna." 

The lawmaker pleaded not guilty to the charges. 

Release terms 

Defence lawyers led by MP Wahome asked the magistrate to expedite the case, saying the environment in which their colleague was charged was “toxic”. 

“Members of the public are outside court. WWe thank the DCI for handling our client well," she said. 

Mr Wilikins Achoki pleaded with the magistrate for Mr Osoro’s release, saying he is not a flight risk. 

But the prosecution opposed the application for his release on a free bond, saying a surety was needed to bind the accused to the court, pending conclusion of the case. 

Mr Osoro was released on a bond of Sh100, 000, with a surety of the same amount, or a cash bail of Sh50,000 in the case that will be mentioned on March 22.
