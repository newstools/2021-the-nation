The win ensured Harambee Stars warm up for their upcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nation (Afcon) qualifiers with a morale boosting result. 

Harambee Stars, third in Group “G” of the 2021 Afcon qualifiers with three points, will host leaders Egypt (eight points) on March 26 before travelling to Lome to take on Togo (one point) three days later. 

Goalkeeper Adisa Omar, defender Nahashon Alembi, midfielders Collins Sichenje and Danson Chetambe all earned their debuts with Kenya. 

Kenya started with intent, unmarked Gor Mahia’s John Macharia picking out Rupia inside the box with a cross but the Leopards man reacted slower to get dispossessed.

Abdallah Hassan of Bandari rushed to finish Macharia’s effort in the 20th minute after Rupia forced a pass from the right, but Bright Stars goalkeeper Majak Maling was alert to the danger. 

The visitors survived in the 22nd minute when Rupia turned sweetly inside the box but blazed over the bar when scoring looked easier.

Three minutes later, South Sudan’s Rehan Angier raced on the left wing and sent a dangerous cross that was timely cleared before an onrushing Makueth Wol could connect. 

South Sudan made a change at the half hour mark, Dominic Angelo replacing Jackson Abede.

Harambee Stars coach Jacob “Ghost” Mulee made a double change at the interval, with Kenneth Muguna and Kevin Kimani coming in for Sichenje and Boniface Onyango respectively.

The substitution worked out, as Harambee Stars’ momentum increased, and in the 77th minute Rupia shook Bright Stars’ net with a tap in after Chetambe, an attacking midfielder, found him with a cross inside the box. 

“I am satisfied (with the new players) because they put up a good show,” said Mulee. 

Harambee Stars will face Taifa Stars of Tanzania on Monday at Nyayo and Thursday at Kasarani to complete their three-match friendly assignments ahead of the Afcon qualifiers against Egypt in Nairobi and Togo in Lome. India, referred to as the world’s ‘pharmacy’, is said to be engaging in 'vaccine diplomacy'. Abu Yasir Hassan is said to be a Tanzanian national leading a militant insurgency in gas-rich Mozambique. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe says the largest number of the vaccinations has been recorded in Nairobi.
