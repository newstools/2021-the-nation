That definitely put him right into the cut where he will now try and better his score against the strong field that includes Magical Kenya Open winner Justin Harding of South Africa. 

Starting at the back nine in the morning, Golf Park's Wakhu, who has tried several times to make the cut in the open without much success, said he dropped those shots on three putting. 

“I had a brilliant start, hitting three straight birdies at the 10th,11th and 12th, but made an awful put at the 13th and later on at the 18th hole," said Wakhu, who thanked his sponsor Robert Keter and his USA-based friend for sponsoring him for the two events. 

Coming the front nine, Wakhu hit a lose shot at the third and had a difficult shot to save a par, though he managed to recover by picking up back-to-back birdies at the fifth and sixth, which he said restored his confidence. 

“During the Magical Kenya Open, I tried to improve in the second round by playing defensive which did not work and ended up missing the cut. Inspite of the bogeys I made, I must say my putting has improve a great deal and I will try and make some more birdies in the remaining two rounds, but at the same time try and protect what I already have," he added. 

He said the field this year is very strong with very experienced players capable of making an average of seven birdies in a round. 

“For us to beat these international players we have to make as many birdies if not more than them. We have to push ourselves harder in order to bring ourselves to their level of play."
