Iâ€™m saddened to learn of the passing on of Robin Njogu and his mum. Robin was a consummate journalist and contributed heavily to the development of radio news in the country. Sad loss for his young family, RMS and the media fraternity in the country. May God comfort his family.â€” CS Joe Mucheru EGH (@mucheru) March 16, 2021

Heartbroken to lose a friend and fellow journalist Robin Njogu. The other day when I visited him at the hospital he was cheerful and getting better. He sent me this photo recently of the days when he used to attend my Govt. Spokesperson briefings as reporter.

Death is incomprehensible when it comes for someone you have talked to almost daily, about work and about life, for the last 10 years. ðŸ’”. Rest well brother. I pray for comfort and peace upon your family during this trying season. pic.twitter.com/zM3tDeuY2Vâ€” Oliver Mathenge (@OliverMathenge) March 16, 2021 The US government is piling new pressure on China to allow unfettered access to human rights monitors in the Xinjiang region.
