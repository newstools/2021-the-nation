"I explained raising the concern that the ODM party was planning to rig the election and stated all the avenues they exploited to ensure victory for their candidate David Were," he added. 

He claimed the Amani National Congress, whose leader is politician Musalia Mudavadi, had a vigilant team which caught MPs, MCAs and county officials bribing voters in order for them to favour Mr Were. 

"We found ODM-branded face masks, money, filled tally forms and many other materials related to election malpractices, which we presented to the police,” he said, adding he also recorded a statement on the theft of his money.
