Many more are expected to give birth before the exams end on April 21. The Education ministry is yet to reveal the number of pregnant teens but checks in individual counties indicate that thousands of schoolgirls could soon be mothers. 

In Kericho, 10 candidates sat their first paper in labour wards in Bureti, Ainamoi, Belgut and Kipkelion East sub-counties. The girls are admitted to Roret Health Centre, Kapkatet Sub-county Hospital, Londiani Sub-county Hospital, Kipchimchim Hospital, Kabianga Health Centre and AIC Litein Hospital. 

“One of the candidates from Londiani in Kipkelion East Sub-county delivered twins and is sitting the exams in hospital,” said Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya. 

In Rangwe Sub-county, Homa Bay County, six candidates started the exams from maternity beds after delivering. One was still in hospital yesterday. 

Pregnant learners 

Deputy County Commissioner Thomas Nyoro told Nation that arrangements had been made to ensure that the candidate comfortably sits the exam. 

“We will make sure she sits and completes all her tests as instructed by the government. She will sit for some papers in the hospital while she is recuperating,” Mr Nyoro said yesterday. 

The high number of pregnant learners has been attributed to irresponsible teenage sexual behaviour during the long school closure forced by Covid-19 from mid-March last year. 

KCSE and KCPE candidates reopened on October 12, 2020 while the rest of the learners resumed in-person learning in January. 

In West Pokot, eight candidates did not sit their exams from school after giving birth in different hospitals, according to county director of education Jared Onyiego. The situation is also the same in Nandi County where four girls are doing their exams away from their schools.
