Burial tomorrow 

Sheikh Musa Ismail Haji, chair of the Kisumu Muslim Association, said Mama Sarah will be buried on Tuesday morning. 

He explained that the family was allowed more time before the burial as some members need to travel from far-flung areas. 

"Mama did not die of Covid-19-related issues. We wish to clarify that she has been sick for some time," Sheikh Musa said, who spoke on behalf of the family, said at the hospital in Kisumu. 

The family had kept Mama Sarah’s health status under wraps, not divulging details of what she was suffering from until her death on Monday. 

In 2019, she was admitted to Siaya County Referral Hospital after falling ill at her home.
