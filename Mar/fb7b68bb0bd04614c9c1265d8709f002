A police report seen by Nation.Africa says officers in the company of Lagdera Deputy Sub-county  Police Commander Adan Ibrahim Edin undertook the operation after suspecting criminal activity. 

They flagged down a car along Baraki-Maalmin road but its occupants sped off, necessitating a search. 

“The vehicle was spotted on the outskirts of Maalmin about 40km south of Lagdera police station. NPR officers Adow Yussuf and Khalif Abdullahi Muhumed, using their personal vehicle, gave a chase and managed to block the vehicle,” the report stated.

In the car were 30-year-old Nur Ibrahim Alaso, who was the driver, 21-year-old Jimale Abey Mahamud and 24-year-old Abdirizack Mohamed Ali. 

They were arrested for questioning on why they were transporting items that also included eight empty AK-47 magazines and 20 litres of petrol, which were found in the boot of the car.

Rono Bunei, Northeastern Regional Police Commander, said the police chase took four hours. 

Mr Bunei said police who were patrolling the area spotted the salon car at about 5pm on Monday before the driver sped off, prompting the chase. 

"The three suspicious occupants sped off to the bushes when being stopped. The operation was mounted to trace and arrest the occupants of the vehicle," he said in Garissa.
