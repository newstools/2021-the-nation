Led by Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, the politicians have written a letter to the Inspector-General of Police and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA)seeking their intervention to ensure the elections are conducted in a fair and credible manner. 

In the letter seen by the Nation, the leaders say their rivals have planned to use the police to cause chaos and disrupt voting in tomorrow's by-election.

UDA strongholds 

“There is an elaborate plan to threaten, blockade and curtail the movement of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) supporters tomorrow. In Nakuru Town West, Jubilee Party has liaised with Sub county police commander Samson Gathuku to subvert the will of the people of London Ward," Senator Kihika said in the letter. 

"There are plans to also use hired goons to cause mayhem in UDA strongholds in the Ward and prevent them from voting for our candidate," she added. 

Leaders allied to UDA party now want urgent intervention by the Inspector General of Police and the IPOA to stop the 'planned violence.' 

The politicians have also accused security officers of turning a blind eye in incidents involving voter bribery.

"We want the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to step in and ensure the by-elections are fair and credible. We urge IEBC to also intervene and act against the voter bribery that has been experienced in London Ward since last week," further stated Senator Kihika. 

However, Nakuru West Sub-County police commander Samson Gathuku said enough security officers will be deployed to each polling station to ensure there are no disruptions during the by-elections. 

"About 200 security officers will be deployed to the polling stations and the tallying centre to beef up security and ensure the exercise runs smoothly. I also urge the electorate to turn up and exercise their democratic right and go home. We want to have a free, fair and credible mini-polls, "said the police boss. 

The London and Hell's Gate seats fell vacant following the deaths of Samuel Mbugua and John Njenga in November 2020. 

Meanwhile, IEBC says all is set for the London and Hell's Gate by-elections. 

Nakuru County IEBC manager Silas Rotich on Tuesday revealed that adequate preparations have been made to ensure the exercise runs smoothly without any hitches.

The IEBC official said election materials including ballot papers and boxes will be transported to all the polling stations in London and Hell's Gate Wards by Wednesday, under tight security. 

The IEBC manager said, the by-elections will be held under strict Covid-19 guidelines to curb the spread of the virus. 

He said special clerks have been designated to ensure voters wear facemasks and adhere to social distancing and washing of hands with soap before accessing voting centres. 

“Wearing of facemask and adhering to social distancing protocols is a must,” he declared. 

The Nation established that at least 18,000 eligible voters will take part in the London Ward by-election. 

In Naivasha's Hell's Gate, about 24,000 voters are expected to participate in the exercise. 

London Ward Returning Officer Gilbert Serem told the Nation that learning activities in schools that are being used as polling centers will not be interrupted. 

"IEBC has made adequate arrangements with the Ministry of Education and therefore activities in the learning institutions will not be interrupted. In London we will be using most schools as polling centres,” said Mr Serem. 

London Ward has seven polling stations which include; Uhuru primary, Milimani Primary, Moi secondary, Moi primary, Crater, Public works offices and at the County Council.
