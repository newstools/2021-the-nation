Mr Lilan said security and education officials are on high alert to ensure the integrity of the exams is protected. 

Credibility of exams 

Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has indicated that Homa Bay is an exams cheating hotspot. 

In Homa Bay, Mr Lilan said neighboring counties like Kisii have had a history of exam malpractice.  

He said the negative reports from Kisii is what makes Homa Bay to fall in the list of areas where candidates can collude to cheat in exams. 

“We have made arrangements with security and education officers from other counties to ensure the credibility of the exams is protected in the region. Any attempt of cheating will be dealt with accordingly,” the county commissioner said. More than 700,000 candidates write their final secondary school examinations. Education CS says any centre found to engage in unethical practices will face stern action. The President has declared Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru disease infested counties. Murang'a senator says he is recovering at home after a week of hospitalisation. Officials say they can’t turn away those who want the vaccine because groups prioritised for the drug are reluctant.
