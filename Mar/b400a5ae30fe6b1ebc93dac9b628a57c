Acting Health Director-General Patrick Amoth on Friday became the first person to get the Covid-19 vaccine jab on Kenyan soil. 

The jab was administered at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). Three healthcare workers were also inoculated.  

The first batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in the country on Tuesday night. The 1.02 million doses were shipped from the Serum Institute of India (SII).

Dr Amoth said the government is targeting vaccination of 1.25 million Kenyans by June.  

"We're doing the vaccination in phases. Phase 1 starts now until June 30 which targets 1.25 million Kenyans. Phase 2 will commence thereafter to target about 9.6 million Kenyans," he said.  

The next batch of vaccines is expected in the country by end of March or April. The caution to people suffering the specific allergies has split expert opinion locally. Outbreak of the coronavirus was reported at their training camp in Nanyuki in January. Abandoned by his biological parents, Dr Gitamo has overcome many challenges in life to realise his ‘American Dream’. Plan will see an extra 150 poll units in the past 10 years, nearly twice the number added over previous 47 years. President Kenyatta wants the public to be cautious about politicians making empty promises.
