Mr Moroto was arrested on Sunday evening after visiting families evicted from a settlement scheme along the border West Pokot and Trans-Nzoia counties, which is surrounded by controversies. 

More than 500 families were rendered homeless after their homes and property were destroyed during evictions that took place under heavy security. 

Mr Moroto visited families camping at Katikomor market and Katikomor Primary School in the company of journalists and human rights defenders. 

He was on his way to Kitale when he was stopped at Robinson by detectives from Endebess Sub-county and ordered to surrender.

His car was blocked and searched by officers who arrested him, saying they had a warrant of arrest issued in 2017. 

Mr Moroto was then driven to Endebess Police Station and later taken to Kitale Police station where he spent the night. 

The MP was charged before Senior Principal Magistrate Symphie Makila 

He denied the charges and was freed on a bond of Sh1 million or a cash bail of Sh500,000. 

Endebess DCI commander Peter Ochieng said, however, that more charges related to incitement will be preferred against him. 

The case will be mentioned on March 15.
