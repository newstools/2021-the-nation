Athletics Kenya’s richest marathon race is penned for April 11Athletes battling for share of Sh18m prize fund will be timed electronically The launch of registration for 2021 Eldoret City Marathon is light at the end of the tunnel for many athletes in Kenya as Covid-19 continues to disrupt sporting activities globally, denying runners opportunities of earning income. 

On Friday, organisers of Eldoret City Marathon launched registration for the competition with a total prize fund of Sh18 million in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County.

This year, athletes will be timed electronically through the sponsorship of Golazo Right Here Sports, a local affiliate  of  Belgium-based event management company Golazo Sport. 

According to two time Boston Marathon champion Moses Tanui who is the race director, athletes will be able to time themselves in real time because the chip is accurate. 

“I urge athletes to continue training. This year, registered times will be official because we want to improve our race to international standards. Athletes will be timed electronically,” Tanui said during the launch of registration in Eldoret. 






The third edition of the race will be held on April 11 and organisers have urged athletes to register online or through particular registration centres. 

“We have launched the registration process.  Those wishing to compete can visit our website and register  with Sh1,200. It is a simple process, but we will also follow health protocols from the Ministry of Health,” said Tanui. 

Many athletes have been training at home after the coronavirus pandemic disrupted sporting activities globally, and Tanui has said competitors  should expect a fast race. 

“When athletes stay at home training with no competition, there is probability for them to run faster times and we expect a course record which will also be a boost for us as race organisers,” added Tanui.
