The 28-year-old revealed last month when speaking at the Financial Times' Business of Football summit he would no longer perform a gesture which has been followed by Premier League players, officials and staff since June. 

"My decision to stand at kick-off has been public knowledge for a couple of weeks now," Zaha said in a statement released on Saturday. 

"There is no right or wrong decision, but for me personally I feel kneeling has just become a part of the pre-match routine and at the moment it doesn't matter whether we kneel or stand, some of us still continue to receive abuse. 






"I know there is a lot of work being done behind the scenes at the Premier League and other authorities to make change, and I fully respect that, and everyone involved. I also fully respect my team-mates and players at other clubs who continue to take the knee. 

"As a society, I feel we should be encouraging better education in schools, and social media companies should be taking stronger action against people who abuse others online - not just footballers. 

"I now just want to focus on football and enjoy being back playing on the pitch. I will continue to stand tall."

The gesture was brought in as a way to promote the anti-racism message after the death in police custody of George Floyd in the United States last May sparked a rise in Black Lives Matter protests. India, referred to as the world’s ‘pharmacy’, is said to be engaging in 'vaccine diplomacy'. Abu Yasir Hassan is said to be a Tanzanian national leading a militant insurgency in gas-rich Mozambique. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe says the largest number of the vaccinations has been recorded in Nairobi.
