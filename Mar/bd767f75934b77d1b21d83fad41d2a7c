While he did not disclose who the recipient of Kenya's first dose will be, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe had previously indicated that healthcare workers would be the first to receive Covid-19 jabs. 

The vaccine doses flagged off today by Mr Kenyatta are destined for other parts of the country including Eldoret, Nakuru Kakamega and Kisumu counties. 

According to Dr Willis Akhwale, the head of the vaccines taskforce, almost half of the shots have already been dispatched to regional depots. These include Nairobi, Meru Nyeri, Garissa and Mombasa whose doses were dispatched on Wednesday just hours after the drugs touched down at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) from India.
