‘’As a bank, we appreciate the tenacity, hard work and resilience that goes into the preparation for such a tournament, and how difficult this must have been during a pandemic. This is what we call the Africanacity Spirit - the distinct ability to always find ingenious ways to get things done despite the challenges we face.
