At the same time, Kenya will now be represented by four boxers at this year’s Games. Elizabeth Akinyi (welterweight) and Elly Ajowi (heavyweight) were Saturday handed Tokyo tickets by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Boxing Task Force courtesy of the continental quota system. 

This is after the IOC’s Boxing Task Force cancelled the final World Qualifier that was scheduled to be held in Paris in June. 

The duo join Nick “Commander” Okoth (welterweight) and Christine Ongare (flyweight) who earned their Tokyo berths via the Africa qualifiers.

“We want to send a strong team to the Olympics Games in Tokyo, Japan and since we have just a few months left, we saw it wise to support some of the probable athletes in a small way as we wait for more funding from the Ministry of Sports,”  Tergat said on Saturday. 

He said support will also be extended to other Kenyan sportsmen and women who have qualified for the Olympics as the country eyes more medals in the July 23 to August 8 Games. 

“This time round, we want to get things right and since it’s my first event since I got into the office, I will be happy to see the team that will be selected to represent Kenya bag more medals than before,” added Tergat. 

He urged athletes to continue training hard and practice clean sport as they head to the games which are less than four months away. 

He also asked those who are in anti-doping test pool to ensure they keep authorities informed of their whereabouts at all times as required. 

Kenyan teams competing in taekwondo, volleyball, and rugby will be in Kurume City in Japan  for between five days and two weeks.
