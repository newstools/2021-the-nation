Refined sugar, like the kind found in sweets, chocolate, biscuits, can cause acneAlthough antibiotics usually by kills the bacteria causing the spots, the medication also kills all the “friendly” bacteria that live in your gut Sugar is worse than you think 

As numerous clinical studies have shown, people with acne do not process sugar well in their bodies. Refined sugar, like the kind found in sweets, chocolate, biscuits, can cause acne. But notice that I use the word “can” and not “will. Refined sugar is often thought of as inflammatory and fresh fruits and vegetables, anti-inflammatory. Get the balance right, and you can carry on eating your favourite chocolate.

Which fruit and vegetables have the most powerful anti-inflammatory properties? The ones that are brightest in colour – its Mother Nature's way of telling us they’re rich in antioxidants, like vitamin C and E, and the carotenoids. So try boosting your intake of red/orange/yellow vegetables and fruits such as sweet potatoes, carrots, apricots and watermelon, purple foods such as berries and grapes, green foods such as watercress, sukuma and broccoli, 'seed' foods such as peas, onions and garlic, and wholegrains, fresh nuts, seeds and their oils. 






Getting it right in the gut 

Unless you’re emptying your bowels once a day, a build-up of toxic material inside the intestines is likely. When that happens, toxins can be reabsorbed back into the body. Let me paint you a picture: think of a sewer system which has nowhere to flow to, and now imagine all the build-up and leakage that would follow. That’s the same thing that happens in your gut when you don’t “go”. Quite simply, once the toxins are reabsorbed, they erupt on your skin. 

There are ample ways to increase the amount of fibre in your diet – more fresh fruits and vegetables, wholemeal bread, porridge, lentils and beans. All of these will help keep your gut regular and healthy, and in turn your skin.

Antibiotics do more harm than good 

If you go to a doctor complaining about acne, chances are you’ll be prescribed antibiotics to calm your inflamed skin. Although this usually does the trick by killing the bacteria causing the spots, the medication also kills all the “friendly” bacteria that live in your gut.  

Without these “friendly” bacteria to protect you, when you eventually do come off the medication, “unfriendly” bacteria start to overgrow in the gut. Not only do they release toxins, they also create other problems, including - wait for it –acne! So off you go to get another course of antibiotics, and so long as you keep taking them, your skin will be OK.  

If the catch-22 situation you’re in, I suggest taking a nutritional supplement called a probiotic for a few weeks. Probiotics are designed to replenish the “friendly” bacteria in your gut and in turn, help solve your skin problems.
