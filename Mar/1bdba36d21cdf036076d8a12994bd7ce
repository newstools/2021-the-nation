Uganda has suspended the launch of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project to mourn the death of Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli who the country says was instrumental in conception of the project.

Petroleum Authority of Uganda (PAU), in a statement issued here on Tuesday, said the launch has been deferred to next month. 

"President Magufuli's astute leadership set a strong foundation for the EACOP project, with key milestones that included the Inter-Governmental Agreement in 2017, and initialling of the Tanzania Host Government Agreement in 2020," the statement said. 

Construction of the 1,445-km oil pipeline from the oil wells in western Uganda to Tanzania's seaport of Tanga is scheduled to start soon, according to the Ugandan government. 

The 3.55-billion-US-dollar pipeline will be the longest electrically heated pipeline in the world. It is heated because of the waxy nature of Uganda's oil. Uganda has so far discovered over 6.5 billion barrels of oil. Kampala says it realised that it will be cheaper using Tanzaniaâ€™s Tanga port. President Magufuli changed the narrative that Kenya was the king in matters business by snatching crucial agreements. The DP is facing a fresh political onslaught from, pro-BBI leaders keen to lock him out of their regions in the 2022 succession race. Mr Thakrar, 69, was suspended from the company he founded last month over claims of gross misconduct. The government is citing national security threats posed by some of the refugees.
