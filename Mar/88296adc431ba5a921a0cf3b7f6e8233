Tree tomato farmers in Nyandarua are counting losses after a strange disease invaded farms, killing several plants. 

Farmers said most plants are affected at the flowering stage. 

The farmers have spent a lot of money on farm chemicals. 

The plants appear healthy and die in two to three days after the first sign of infection.

It is a double tragedy for growers who abandoned potato and dairy farming to engage in the otherwise lucrative tamarillo farming. 

The fruit earns farmers at least Sh80 per kilo. 

The most affected area is the dry Ndaragua constituency. 

Bacterial infection 

Agronomists suspect that the disease could be a bacterial infection, which is disastrous in tomatoes and same family crops. 

Mr Philip Mwangi, an agronomist, advises farmers to practise crop rotation in the affected farms and observe crop hygiene.

“I have tried all chemicals as advised by agronomists but they are not working. I’m losing my plants at an alarming rate when I have exhausted all my savings taking care of the crop,” said Mr Daniel Kuria from Muruku area. 

“I have tried more than 10 chemicals as advised by agricultural officers and farm chemical manufacturers but they are not working. I planted the crop in November and I have since been spending Sh6,000 every week buying water to irrigate the plants. My timing was to have them at flowering and fruiting stage by the time long rains start,” said Ms Alice Wangui, a farmer from Gwa Kung’u area. 

She said the disease does not spare any species of the tree tomato plants. Even the grafted ones, said to be resistant to pests and diseases, are equally affected.

''I appeal to the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research and Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service to intervene,” said Ms Wangui. The farmers have since called on the County Government to send extension officers to advise them. Farmers have had to contend with the challenge of feeding aflatoxin-contaminated and poor-quality feeds to their livestock. This comes just days after parliament declined to ratify the controversial Kenya-UK trade deal. CS says deal contains provisions for protecting Kenya and EAC market from unfair competition. Prosecution says the accused is still mentally unfit to stand trial and is still under medication.
