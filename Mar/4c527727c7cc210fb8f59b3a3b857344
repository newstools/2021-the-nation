The death toll rose by seven to 1,908 and the number of recoveries by 117 to 88,326. Kenya has vaccinated at least 9,144 of its frontline workers against the Covid-19 coronavirus disease since launching its campaign last week. 

Kenya is among several countries using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. 

President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the public to get vaccinated, as local medical experts say the vaccine is safe, but has noted that inoculation is voluntary.

Several countries across the world, including the DR Congo, have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine for reasons including links to blood clots. India is reviewing the vaccine's side effects following these concerns. 

In a statement on Saturday, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said 2,020 of the 9,144 vaccinations took place in Nairobi, 1,304 in Uasin Gishu, 764 in Kisumu and 562 in Nakuru.

ambuthia@ke.nationmedia.com Exactly one year ago today, Kenya reported its first case of coronavirus, throwing the country into confusion. History has taught us that there is no disease that has persevered forever and if there is one like common cold, we have learnt to live with it. India, referred to as the world’s ‘pharmacy’, is said to be engaging in 'vaccine diplomacy'. Abu Yasir Hassan is said to be a Tanzanian national leading a militant insurgency in gas-rich Mozambique.
