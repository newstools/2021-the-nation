Saccos will bridge your financial gap, but with so many Saccos around, it can be difficult for you to spot the Sacco that will grow your money. To guide you, here are some of the top Saccos in Kenya by dividends and return on share capital. 

Police Sacco 

This Sacco was founded in 1972 and has branches in Nairobi, Eldoret, Kakamega, Nyeri, Kisii, Nakuru, Meru, and Mombasa.

The Sacco has a fixed deposit account option where the interest paid varies according to the amount of money saved. For example, if you save between Sh10,000 and Sh49,999 for one year, your savings will earn 7 per cent interest or between Sh700 and Sh3,499. If you save Sh200,000 to Sh1 million in this fixed account, you will earn interest at a rate of 8.5 per cent or between Sh17,000 and Sh85,000. Their highest fixed account interest is 12 per cent on Sh10 million and above.

Pay attention to these pointers, say experts

According to two financial video logs by Rina Hicks, a certified professional coach and investment banker, and Peter Gichinga, the board chair at Safaricom Investment Cooperative, this is what you should look out for when scouting for a Sacco: 

Bylaws: Read the bylaws and understand how the Sacco you are interested in operates. Bylaws should answer questions such as how to exit, how to sell your shares, costs involved if you want to exit or swap shares. They should also tell you what will happen if you fail to pay the minimum monthly contribution. In most Saccos, the share capital is not withdraw-able but can be sold or transferred to an existing member upon your withdrawal from a Sacco. 

The return on investment: Know what returns on average you should expect to get. If your money is locked for a year, how much interest will it earn? What value will you get if you invest in the Sacco's share capital?

Membership diversity: If a Sacco was started by teachers or farmers, how far has it gone in creating diversity? The best Saccos have a diversity of membership. Don't go for a Sacco that is exclusively run by one category of people. 

Long-term value: Get in a Sacco where you know people who can guarantee you loans if need be. You should also look at whether a Sacco offers secured loans. 

Management: Look at the board members and how past decisions and policies have been executed. Also, look at the Sacco's liquidity ratio to see the amount of savings versus disbursed loans. See where and how deposited funds are invested. Find out if the Sacco offers full disclosures on accounts and loans or not. 

Automation: Don't go for a Sacco that will require you to travel to its headquarters to sign withdrawals or make a share swap or apply for a loan. Go for a Sacco that has automated its operations and accepts automation items such as standing orders.
