Deputy President William Ruto has told President Uhuru Kenyatta and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga to support his presidential bid and stop inciting the public against him. 

Dr Ruto said he supported Mr Odinga’s bid in 2007, an election that resulted in the formation of the coalition government.

The DP said he played a role in elevating Mr Odinga to prime minister in the elections that were marred by violence “that led to my prosecution at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague”. 

“While I was at the ICC, the person I was fighting for did not even visit me,” he said in Busia yesterday.  

Dr Ruto added that Mr Odinga has not held any senior government position since they parted ways. 

He said Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Amani National Congress’ Musalia Mudavadi and Mr Moses Wetang’ula of Ford Kenya have failed to assist Mr Odinga win an election. 






Dr Ruto said after coming back from The Hague, he joined hands with President Uhuru Kenyatta and “together, we won in the election”. 

Presidential contest 

“Mr Kenyatta became President while I his deputy. I again supported Mr Kenyatta in 2017. Even after the Supreme Court nullified his victory, we won in the repeat presidential contest,” he said. 

According to the DP, it is wrong for the President and the ODM leader to attack. 

He said they should instead appreciate and reciprocate to his support. 

“It should not turn out that I was only a very good person when I supported them to get those positions in government,” he said. 

“When my turn comes and the hustlers turn comes, they incite the public against me. I want them to appreciate the support I gave them.”

He added that he is prepared to compete the forces opposed to his presidential ambition. 

“I know they are standing in my way, but they should know that I am prepared to lead the hustlers,” he said. 

The DP later conducted fundraisers for boda bodas in Port Victoria Budalangi before heading to Funyula, Matayos and Teso South. He contributed Sh1 million to every boda boda group. 

Dr Ruto was accompanied by Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga, Malava’s Malulu Injendi and former Teso South MP Mary Emase. 

Few votes 

He thanked the people of Busia for partly voting for Jubilee in the last General Election. 

“I came here with President Kenyatta to ask for your votes in 2017. Even though you voted for ODM overwhelmingly, I say thank you for the few votes you gave us,” he said. 

The DP said the March 9, 2018 handshake between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga that gave rise to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) disrupted the Jubilee development agenda. 

He said he and the President had projected to tarmac roads, connect electricity to every region, revive and reconnect railway lines, put up technical training institutions in each constituency and create jobs for young people. 

“We were working on those projects but BBI scuttled everything. Some projects even stalled,” the DP said.

He added that Kenyan small scale traders would be funded through the National Government Constituency Development Fund “when I become president in 2022”. 

Dr Ruto said every constituency would be given Sh100 million for loans to help micro enterprises and boost revenue generation at the grassroots.
