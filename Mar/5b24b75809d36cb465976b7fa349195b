Dennis Schroder scored 24 points Sunday as the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers held on late for a much-needed 96-93 NBA victory over the Orlando Magic. 

The reigning NBA champion Lakers won their second straight game after dropping four in a row since superstar LeBron James suffered a high right ankle sprain, joining star big man Anthony Davis on the sidelines. 

Kyle Kuzma added 21 points for the Lakers, who rallied from five points down with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter against the second-worst team in the Eastern Conference. 

A 12-1 scoring run helped the Lakers take a seven-point lead with 2:56 to play. 

But amid a stream of missed shots by the Lakers, the Magic sliced the deficit to three. 

Orlando's Otto Porter Jr. had a chance to tie it on the final possession, but his three-point attempt bounced off the back of the rim, to the relief of the increasingly desperate-looking Lakers. 

"We made some mistakes at the end, couldn't really get shots to fall, but we got the win and on to the next," said Lakers forward Markieff Morris. 

"It certainly wasn't pretty," said Lakers coach Frank Vogel, "but we executed well. 

"We got high quality shots," Vogel said before adding with a laugh: "We couldn't throw it in the ocean. 

"I think it's a good win for our guys," he concluded. "I'm proud of how they competed." 

The Lakers are due to get reinforcements, with the signing of free agent center Andre Drummond confirmed shortly before tip-off. 

"Andre Drummond gives us powerful, anchor-point skills on both ends of the court," Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said.

Raptors lose again 

CJ McCollum starred late for Portland, scoring seven of his 23 points in the last two minutes as the Trail Blazers beat the Toronto Raptors 122-117. 

Damian Lillard scored 22 points and handed out 11 assists for the Blazers, who held the Raptors to 10 points in the third quarter to take charge of the contest. 

Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 26 points and Fred VanVleet added 20 with eight assists, but the Raptors lost for the 11th time in 12 games. 

The contest came days after the trade that sent Norman Powell from the Raptors to Portland for Gary Trent and Rodney Hood. 

Powell scored 13 points against his old team. Drummond should also mesh well with the Lakers' top duo when they return. Mitchell took charge early, making his first five shots on the way to scoring 28 first-half points -- his most ever in a half.
