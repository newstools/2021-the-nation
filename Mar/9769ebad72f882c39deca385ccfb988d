President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday ordered the suspension of sports and closure of clubs in a move aimed at checking against the spread of the coronavirus, currently in its third wave. 

Consequently, Sunday's KCB Machakos Rally, the second round of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC), was cancelled at the 11th hour. 

In a statement issued on Friday, KMSF chairman Phineas Kimathi said the situation around the African Rally Championship Equator Rally will be looked into before further plans are announced. 

“The African Rally Championship Equator Rally, scheduled to be held in Kenya on April 24 and 25, 2021, will be the subject of discussion with all stakeholders next week and a decision will be taken and communicated in good time,” said Kimathi, who is also the chief executive officer of the World Rally Championship Safari Rally. 

“Let us all remain patient as we wait for the return to normalcy,’’ he appealed. 

The WRC Safari Rally will be held from June 24 to 27 principally around Naivasha. Next month’s Equator Rally will also run in Naivasha and on sections to be used for the Safari. 

It is highly likely that both competitions will take place as scheduled, but under strict Covid-19 protocols given the groundwork already done, especially for the Safari Rally that is making a return to the World Rally Championships after 19 years in the cold. 

Already, the WRC Safari Rally has appointed a Covid-19 compliance officer with regular tests scheduled for anyone working for both the Equator Rally and the Safari and safe zones created at the Service Park at Naivasha’s Kenya Wildlife Service Training Institute.

The Service Park will be used for both the Equator Rally and the Safari. 

For the WRC Safari Rally, after the ceremonial start from the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, the cars will head to the Moi International Sports Centre for the Super Special Stage before hitting the transport section to Naivasha where the main action will be based.   

Already, foreign crews from as far as South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe have transported their competition cars and service parts ahead of the Equator Rally which will have added importance as it will be a dry run for the WRC Safari Rally both for competitors and organisers. 

Motorsports, like all other sporting events, was suspended in March last year by the government to contain the spread of the coronavirus with rally action resuming early this year with the opening KNRC round in Nakuru.  

KMSF is the national motorsports governing body mandated to oversee rallying, autocross, karting, and hill climb events by the government and the International Motorsport Federation.
