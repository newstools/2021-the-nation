The project titled ‘Stabilization and Recovery of Communities Affected by Violent Extremism, Conflict and Disasters in Kenya’ is currently being implemented by Community Road Empowerment (CORE). 

The site manager, Amos Biwott, on Friday told journalists who visited the projects site at Kibochi village in Kanduyi constituency, Bungoma County, where a two-kilometer road is being constructed, that the project aims to support communities affected by disasters.  

"Under this project, UNDP has incorporated other stakeholders such as National Drought Management Agency (NDMA), National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC), National Steering Committee (NSC), Toyota Kenya Foundation and Community Road Empowerment," said Mr Biwott. 

Mr Biwott said that the project will create jobs for hundreds of youths who have been greatly affected by Covid-19 pandemic.
