His condition deteriorated and was taken to hospital. 

Ngugi first vied for the Muguga ward seatin 2013 through the Farmers Party and lost. 

In 2017, he contested for the same seat again on a Jubilee Party ticket and won. 

He was very active during the impeachment of former Kiambu Governor Ferdinard Waititu. 

 Kiambu Jubilee caucus chairman Elijah Njoroge, who is also the Biashara MCA, mourned Ngugi as a humble man who put the interests of the people he represented in the assembly first. Mr Njoroge said assembly has lost a diligent, honest and focused leader.

 Ngugi’s death comes nearly a year after Kiambu County Assembly lost another MCA. 

Cyrus Omondi of Kahawa Wendani ward died while on an official visit in India. The cause of his death was never made public. In just 12 months, the number of the dead has swelled – now heading towards 1,900 in Kenya. It's been one year since Covid-19 was confirmed in Kenya, and only photos can best help us tell the story. The new prices have made Kenya the most expensive fuel market in the region. All the six lawyers representing Sonko, including Dr Khaminwa, walked out of court in protest today. Turnout of Kakamega's frontline health workers remains low.
