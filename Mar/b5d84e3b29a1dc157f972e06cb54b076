The ministry further reported 114 more recoveries, 74 of them in hospital and 40 in the home-based care programme, raising the tally to 89,622. 

As of Sunday, the CS said, 889 patients had been admitted to health facilities countywide while 2,545 were being treated at home. 

The number of those in intensive care units dropped by two to 121, with 32 of the patients on ventilatory support, 86 on supplemental oxygen and three under observation. 

Another 59 patients were separately on supplementary oxygen, 41 of them in general wards and 18 in high dependency units. 

Vaccination 

Regarding the ongoing vaccination campaign, Mr Kagwe said the plan is intact and targets all persons residing in Kenya including those serving in diplomatic corps. 

"This first phase targets frontline workers who include health care workers, teachers and support staff in learning institutions, those serving in the security sector and others in all ports of entry," the CS said. 

He was responding to media reports that the vaccine deployment plan is being abused. 

Kenya has offered free Covid-19 vaccines to all diplomats even though it has not completed inoculating its own health workers, other front-line staff or the elderly.
