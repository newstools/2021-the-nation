After ruling the Kenyan music airwaves for more than a decade, at a time music wasn’t paying much, the Longombas relocated to the US several years ago. 






In 2015, after a long hiatus in the US, the brothers attempted to make a comeback by releasing My Queen, which proved to be their last composition. Lovy got saved and transitioned to being a pastor in Los Angeles. 

Famous musical family 

The Longombas hail from a famous musical family. Their father Lovy Longomba Snr was a member of popular Congolese band Super Mazembe, which was based in Nairobi in the 1970s and 80s, while their grandfather Vicky Longomba was a member of TPOK Jazz band.
