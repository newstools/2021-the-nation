"Following the untimely demise of Tanzanian President, His Excellency, Dr. John Pombe Magufuli, Football Kenya Federation, in consultation with the Tanzanian Football Federation has made a decision to cancel today’s international friendly match between the National Team Harambee Stars and the Tanzanian National Football Team, which was scheduled to take place at the Nyayo National Stadium, beginning 3pm," FKF CEO Barry Otieno said in a statement.

"Football Kenya Federation wishes to extend its deepest sympathy and message of goodwill to the Tanzanian Football Federation, the family and friends of the late President and the good people of Tanzania. May the Lord bless you with the strength to sail though this tough situation."

Kenya will play Egypt and Togo at home and away on March 25 and 29, while Tanzania, under new coach Kim Poulsen, have a date with Equatorial Guinea and Libya on the same dates. Detectives are still trying to unravel how and where Owino acquired weapon handling skills. Since the election of Magufuli as President in 2015, Tanzania’s human rights record had deteriorated.
