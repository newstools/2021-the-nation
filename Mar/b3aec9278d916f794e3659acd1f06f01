Otieno, who has personal best 10.14seconds, downed 10.24sec this time around, a day after gliding to victory in the semi-final in 10.17. 

Omanyala, who finished second in the semis in 10.32sec settled for similar position behind Otieno in 10.40sec. 

"My target was to hammer the Tokyo Olympic Games qualifying time of 10.05sec but my calf brought complications. It was a bit tight," said the 27-year-old Otieno, who welcomed the all fierce competition from Omanyala. 






"He is raw when it comes to competition. He means business and that is a great motivation since it pushes us to the limit," said Otieno. 

"Jitters and fears of false start got into my nerves and I think I need to work on that," said Omanyala, who blasted to wind assisted 10.11sec in January during the relay series. He would clock 10.18sec, 10.61 and 10.29 during the first track and field meeting last month. 

National 200m record holder Maximilla Imali won women's 100m in 11.95sec, beating Doreen Waka and Monica Safania to second and third places in 12.19sec and 12.19sec respectively.
