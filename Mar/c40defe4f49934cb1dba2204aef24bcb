“Both schools are located several kilometres from Mlolongo Phase Three. Whenever it rains, our children cannot attend school due to the long distances that they have to walk in the mud,” said Mr James Mutisya, one of the residents. 

Some of the boys in Mlolongo Phase Four have reportedly dropped out of school. Girls wake up at 3am to prepare for the long walk to school, and return after 8pm. 






“Some of them have fallen pregnant because they are waylaid by men on their way to school,” explained Mr Stephen Muia. 

Sink a borehole 

The situation, Mr Muia added, was a burdened both parents and children. Most of the children are often very exhausted such that they are unable to do their homework or to eat well, the parents say.  The area also lacks water, with no borehole nearby. 

“We are asking the government to build us a school and sink a borehole here,” explained Mr Mutisya. 

Mlolongo Phase Four, which borders Katani, has got over 4,000 residents. 

The area, which features black cotton soil, has got poor roads and most of the residents are low income earners, who run small businesses. 

The children also joined their parents in the tree-planting exercise on the site for the proposed school, where they also erected a signpost.

Besides the need for a public primary school, better roads, piped water and electricity in the area, Mlolongo Phase Four also does not have a public health facility. 

The residents lamented that they have brought these issues before the county government, the Ministry of Education and Mavoko Member of Parliament Patrick Makau without much success. The four were covering the by-election at Milimani Primary School polling center. They have embraced modern medicine and education which was forbidden years ago.
