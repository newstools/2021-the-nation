Otieno stopped the clock at 10.17 seconds as Omanyala eased off to second place in 10.32sec to set up yet another mouthwatering 100m final on Saturday. 

Kapsabet's Cherotich won with the fastest time of 15 minutes and 26.7 seconds at the Moi International Sports Centre, beating Beth Chepkemoi also from Kapsabet in 15:37.7. 

Nakuru’s Naomi Chepng'eno romped home third in 15:42.5. 

"I was hoping to run a sub 15 minutes but the windy track couldn't permit that," said Cherotich, who won the 10,000m race during the first leg on February 28 at the Nyayo National Stadium. 






"The 5,000m isn't my race. I am looking for speed to polish my act in 10,000m where I want to get a ticket for the Tokyo Olympic Games," said Cherotich. 

Running for the first time since finishing third at Kenya Defence Forces Cross Country Championships in January, Chepkirui edged out the 2018 World Cross Country Championships Under-20 champion Beatrice Chebet in a sprint finish to win her heat in 15:29.8. 

Chebet clocked 15:30.6 for second place and was followed by Mary Munanu in 15:52.2. 

"It's not the time I wanted but it feels good to win. I still need to polish on my speed work going to the Olympics," said Chepkirui, who is eying a place in the 5,000m for the Tokyo Games.
