Just who did they choose? A year ago, the Covid-19 pandemic became official on our shores. The months that followed since, were uncertain, turbulent, and anxiety-raising. This week the initial vaccines came into the country but without a doubt, the coronavirus era has changed our lives forever. 

It's clear that as we tackle 2021, change-makers are needed now more than ever. As we mark International Women's Day on 8th March, Saturday Magazine wanted to find out which young women hold the future. After all, the young are our hope for tomorrow.

We bring you the incredible women under 30, working to make our lives better, and laying foundations for change that will have a positive impact – not just for 2021, but for many years to come. 

How did we select? Back in January, we asked opinion shapers in various sectors to give us a list of trailblazing young women, who they think are acing it in their fields while making the world a better place. The names came in fast and furious. The list was long. While everyone in the initial list deserved an honour, we needed to narrow this to just a few. We put together a small panel who gave us a final cut. Just who did they choose? 






The roll call starts here. 

Education 

Dr. Gladys Chepkirui Ngetich, 29, an aerospace engineer

From attending school in Lelaibei primary school, deep in the heart of Nakuru County to the University of Oxford in the UK, Chepkirui's academic journey has been inspiring. 

When the 29-year-old scored 298 out of 500 marks during the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in 2004, some quarters may not have expected her to go far, academically. She did. 

Four years later, she emerged the best student in Kipkelion District, having scored an A- that earned her the James Finlay scholarship marking the beginning of her academic success. At JKUAT, where she pursued mechanical engineering, one of the only nine girls in her class of about 80 students, she continued to flourish. Chepkirui graduated with a first-class honours degree in 2015. She got another scholarship in the UK.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




Currently, she is undertaking postdoctoral research at Space Enabled Research Group at MIT under Schmidt Science Fellowship. Chepkirui completed her Ph.D. in Engineering Science (Aerospace) at Oriel College, the fifth oldest of the University of Oxford's constituent colleges, and did her research work at Oxford Thermofluids Institute which prides itself as one of the "most sophisticated turbine and high-speed flow facilities in the UK". She earned her Ph.D. at only 28. Gladys received a patent for the invention of an alternative fabrication method for a double-wall aerofoil as she aspires to bring innovation that will improve people's lives. 

Besides her stellar strides in academics, Chepkirui is a motivational speaker, athlete, footballer, and passionate about woman empowerment. She is a co–founder of iluu, a social empowerment organisation. Detailing her journey in a quest to inspire other young people, Gladys has co-authored a book, The Bold Dream: Transcending the Impossible.

Arts

Walking to school every day, Mumbi who goes by the name "Tsara Arts" developed a fascination with the brightly coloured matatus that plied the Mathare route where she was brought up. However, she knew that getting into the matatu industry, a male-dominated field would be a tall order. In 2014, one of her friends, a matatu artist, agreed to take her on as an apprentice—teaching her everything from scrubbing to spray painting. Since then, she has designed countless matatus.

Neema Nkatha founded Ohana Family Wear Limited with Ohana swimwear as the flagship product in 2017 out of a need. While shopping for a trip, she realised that African-themed swimwear was difficult to find. 

And just like that, an idea was born. Working from scratch and looking to her friends with fashion technical skills for guidance, she developed her own designs and the concept into a business. 

The USIU graduate, background in finance and International Business administration came in handy. Today, Ohana swimwear, which wears debuted at the London Fashion week is a household name and has sold over 2,000 pieces. Neema is part of the Creative DNA Programme, a British Council programme supported by the Foreign Commonwealth Office designed to support fashion businesses in Kenya.
