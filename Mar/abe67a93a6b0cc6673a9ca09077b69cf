NMS had more good news for Mwamba. NMS will renovate the playing pitch and terraces free of charge. 

“They (NMS officials) have even shown us the architectural plan of the bus park and our grounds. If the plan goes through, then we shall have a good facility. NMS will put up more stands for the fans,” the official, who sought anonymity because he is not authorised to talk on the matter, said. 






“This will be a fantastic venue for our fans since the drop-off points for public service vehicles will just be next door. NMS officials have said that they have fallen behind schedule and that they want to finish the construction work as fast as possible,” the official explained.
