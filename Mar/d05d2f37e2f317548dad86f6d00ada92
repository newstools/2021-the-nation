Mama Sarah, as the step-grandmother of former US President Barack Obama was fondly called, was a philanthropist who promoted education for girls and orphans. She died Monday morning in Kisumu. 

President Obama often showed affection towards her and referred to her as “Granny” in his memoir, “Dreams from My Father.” 















Obama’s light moment at Kogelo with the late Mama Sarah

He described meeting her during his 1988 trip to his father’s homeland and their initial awkwardness as they struggled to communicate which developed into a warm bond. She attended his first inauguration as president in 2009. 

Later, Mr Obama spoke about his grandmother again in his September 2014 speech to the UN General Assembly. 

Kenyans and leaders took to social media to mourn her loss, while those who were lucky to have met her shared their memories of Mama Sarah by posting the pictures they took together. 

Here is a snapshot of how people mourned and remembered her on social media. 


Just lost the most important person in my life - my gran, Mama Sarah. My heart is broken! But as I write, not able to stop the tears from pouring, I know I was blessed to have her for so long! My inspiration, my rock, my comfort zone, my safe space. Rest in peace Dani! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/GkkKrL4oYb— Auma Obama (@AumaObama) March 29, 2021
