"It is a great honour for all of us as a team because it is an award for us all," Kimanzi . 

"It was an in season on season preparation for us not easy for everyone, we had to push to some levels that even brought some injuries but because we had one thing in common we wanted to fight together and make sure we make ourselves to be another force. We've walked the journey together and now we are rewarded as a team," the former Harambee Stars coach added. 

On his team's chances of fighting for the title this term, Kimanzi said that the struggles that defending champions Gor Mahia are going through are a testimony that anyone is capable of walking away with the title. 

"Tusker at the moment, to be honest, they are the best team in the league. They are more fluent, winning without a lot of struggle. They seem to have discovered team balance which is working for them." 

Kimanzi was given Sh50,000 and a trophy which was presented by the league's awards committee. The win took the brewers' points tally to 35. Second-half substitute David Simiyu and Victor Omondi scored the goals. She claimed police violated her rights and arrested her without a warrant.
