The London mini-poll had more than 15 candidates eyeing the seat. Other candidates included; Rebecca Moraa Jillo (Third Way Alliance), Joseph Kariuki (The Service Party), Sammy Mugo aka Sonko (Democratic Party of Kenya), Assumpta Wangui, Joseph Kamanyi, Alex Maina, Peter Ngugi, Wesley Kariuki and Erick Njuguna all who vied on independent tickets. 






The London seat fell vacant following the death of Samuel Mbugua in November, last year. The London Ward by-election turned into a contest between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.

Mr Othman Kiguru, who contested on Peoples Empowerment Party (PEP), emerged third after getting 445 votes.
