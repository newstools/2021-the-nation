Former NTV anchor Winnie Mukami has passed away after contracting Covid-19.

She had started her career journey at KBC as a TV and radio current affairs presenter and producer where she worked for two years. 

In 2010, Ms Mukami left NTV after seven years to found her own public relations firm, Winners Frontiers International Limited, which she ran to date. 

In 2018, she was appointed to the board of Kenya Pipeline Company for three years. 

“Having worked in broadcast industry for over eight years, I bring valuable experience acquired from the industry to our various clients at Winners Frontiers,” part of her professional social media account reads. 






Her demise comes two days after Royal Media Services journalist Robin Njogu also succumbed to coronavirus while receiving treatment at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi. 

Friends and former colleagues in the media have eulogised her as gentle and hard-working.

Over the past 2yrs, I came to know her as a true patriot who on the background, loved and served her country with dedication. Winnie yearned for a united Kenya.
