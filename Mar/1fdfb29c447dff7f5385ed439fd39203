President Uhuru Kenyatta, in his address on Friday afternoon, noted that Kenya has reported an increasing Covid-19 positivity rate. This rate is now higher than when the pandemic started, he said.  

He ordered suspension of ordinary sessions of the August house, as well as those in the county assemblies of Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Nakuru and their committees.  

Curfew hours 

The hours of the nationwide curfew have now been revised in the zoned areas, including Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado and Nakuru Counties, to now start at 8pm and end at 4am. Curfew hours across other parts of the country will remain the same, that is, start at 10pm.  

Learning in schools 

Mr Kenyatta has ordered the suspension of all in-person learning at all institutions including universities, tertiary and vocational colleges, except for candidates sitting their examinations and those in medical training institutions until further notices.  

All sporting activities are also suspended, including those conducted by members' clubs.  

Alcohol sale, bars 

Mr Kenyatta has also suspended the operation of bars in the 5 counties hardest hit by Covid-19 effective midnight.  

"Operation of bars is suspended in Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Nakuru. Similarly, the sale of alcohol in eateries in the 5 counties is prohibited until further notice," he ordered, adding that restaurants and eateries in these areas will now provide take away services only. 

Eateries in other parts of the country will continue as usual, in line with public health guidelines.
