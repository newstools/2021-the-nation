The event was earlier primed for May 16-28. 

A communication from African Confederation Volleyball (CAVB) Tuesday night indicated that it had failed to get a waiver from FIVB to hold the event beyond the world governing body season that ends on May 2. 

"This communication is further to our letter of March 16 announcing the organisation of the 2021 CAVB women's club championship in Tunisia. Unfortunately, we failed to secure a waiver from the FIVB to hold our clubs championship beyond the FIVB season which ends on May 2," CAVB said. 

"The Tunisian volleyball Federation has a greed to retain organisation of the championship to be held between April 19 to May 1 in conformity with the FIVB calendar. This event shall still be held in Sousse, Tunisia." 

Kenya Prisons, KCB and Kenya Pipeline are set to represent Kenya in the 12-day event. 

Prisons and KCB qualified for the competition by virtue of finishing first and second respectively during the 2019 Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) play offs, while Pipeline earned their slot courtesy of their bronze medal in the 2019 Clubs Championship in Egypt. 

It however remains to be seen how the local clubs will prepare for the event. All the three Kenyan representatives have players and coaches in the national women's provisional squad for the Olympic Games in Japan. 

KCB for instance has eight players, Mercy Moim, Noel Murambi, Sharon Chepchumba, Edith Wisa,Violet Makuto Leonida Kasaya,Emmaculate Nekesa and Jemimah Siangu in the team that is currently in a bubble at the Moi International Sport Centre Kasarani Indoor Arena.
