Nairobi Water will line up against KDF, while newcomers Nairobi Prisons battle star-studded KCB. 

Nairobi Prisons coach Salome Wanjala said the odds are against them considering the rich squad of their opponents.  

"KCB are favourites, but I will be more interested with the set scores. Our set scores can only be good if we stage a good performance, something that we are keen to do," said the former national team setter.

"We are new in the league and so far we are picking valuable lessons that we hope to use in the forthcoming matches. We need to improve on our blocks and reception going forward," she added. 

Nairobi Water captain Elizabeth Karugu said the tie can go either way, but remained optimistic of a good show. 

"We hope to break the duck," said Karugu. 

KDF will once again be without the experienced middle blocker Jackline Barasa who is away on official duties. KDF coach Pius Birech they have no choice but to go for a win. 

"We hope to win and build on that going forward. Our intention is to return to the play-offs after missing out in the 2019 season," said Birech.
