Speaking to the nation.africa at her office in Chuka town on Wednesday, Tharaka Nithi County Director of Education, Ms Bridget Wambua said that for the private candidates, 40 females will do the national examinations compared to 36 males. 

“We have more candidates for girls compared to boys for both KCPE and KCSE examinations despite the various social challenges facing the girl-child that have been occasioned by Covid-19 pandemic,” said Ms Wambua. 






She said all the registered candidates for KCPE and KCSE in the county reported back to school after the long Covid-19 break that saw many girls impregnated and boys engage in many activities. 

Smooth continuity 

Ms Wambua noted that though there are pregnant candidates, they are going on with learning in various schools while few who are heavily pregnant or have complications are preparing for the examination at home. 

The official said learners from a few private schools that could not resume operations due to the effects of the pandemic were moved to the neigbouring schools for smooth continuity. 

She added that no single Covid-19 infection case had been reported in schools since learning resumed, but urged the institution managements to remain vigilant by strictly adhering to the set health protocols.
