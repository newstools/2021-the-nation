A woman who bore a child with former Kibra MP Ken Okoth has moved to court to block Parliament from releasing any funds to the widow Monica Lavender.

The fees, she added is in arrears and the child might be thrown out of school. Ms Thumbi further says in the application that she is apprehensive that the widow might disinherit her child. 

The nominated MCA wants the court to grant her an order for payment of school fees and reasonable maintenance upon presentation of school fees invoice, pending release of Okoth’s money from National Assembly and Parliament Sacco. 

Ms Thumbi has accused Monica Lavender of failing to disclose to her Okoth’s key assets or give her an indication of value of the funds held in his bank accounts.

According to the court papers despite Ms Thumbi’s lawyers reaching out to the widow she had not informed them about the status of the estate. 

“The Executor (Monica) has failed to neither disclose in her affidavit a key asset nor indicate the value of funds held in the bank, shares held in the Parliament Sacco nor the value of the pension,” she said in an affidavit. 

The matter came up in court on March 1 but the case could not proceed.

During his tenure as Kibra MP, Okoth transformed schools in his constituency and was described by his colleagues in Parliament as a great leader and progressive lawmaker. Ken's wish was for Anne to take good care of their baby boy. Lawyer Mogaka says Ms Thumbi’s son was excluded from the MP’s cremation. She claimed police violated her rights and arrested her without a warrant. It was not clear whether the 26 raised the fine or were taken to jail.
