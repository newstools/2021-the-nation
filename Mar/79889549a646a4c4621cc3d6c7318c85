This year's conference, themed 'Resilience, Recovery and Sustainability', will capitalise on the opportunities and innovations available to MSMEs to help them win.  

NMG chief executive officer, Mr Stephen Gitagama, said SMEs will showcase their products at the summit and also be exposed to export opportunities. The expo will also have SME clinics, business sustainability coaching, financial empowerment and support.

"This economy is significantly driven by SMEs and a number of them were affected in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. We have structured this year's conference to help in recovery and sustainability," Mr Gitagama said. 

"A number of SMEs will come and show how they have managed to deal with the effects of the pandemic and offer opportunities for others to learn," he added. 

The NMG boss said the expo will also offer SMEs an opportunity to dialogue with government regulators and facilitators as well as give them exposure to available SME guarantee schemes, networking and digital communication opportunities. 

NMG says the conference builds on the momentum of the inaugural one that was convened under the theme, 'Powering SMEs for Growth' on February 24 – 25 last year. The last edition attracted 6,000 participants, 91 exhibitors and parastatal heads, and was graced by seven Cabinet Secretaries including Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. It was co-hosted by KNCCI President, Mr Richard Ngatia. Business leaders, policy makers, diplomats, innovators, researchers, young entrepreneurs, and students, among others were also at the event.
