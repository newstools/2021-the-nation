Benta Achieng’s charges lead Zone 'A' with 27 points from nine matches and are still unbeaten in the eight-team table. 

Zetech Sparks, under the tutelage of Bernard Kitola, are fifth on the log with nine points and a defeat to the league leaders will complicate their chances of qualifying for end of season play-offs. 

A win for Thika Queens will see them open a 12-point gap at the top if second-placed Ulinzi Starlets stumble against Kibera Black Stars at Stima grounds in another fixture this weekend. 

Relegation-threatened Mathare United and Makolanders will square it out at KCB Sports Club on Sunday. 

Makolanders have five points from nine matches while Mathare United are rock bottom on four points. 

Kayole Starlets face an uphill task against Gaspo at Stima Grounds as both teams aim to bounce back to winning ways after losing their previous matches.
