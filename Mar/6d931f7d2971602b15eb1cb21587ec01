Joe Biden, who took over as president on January 20, was vaccinated publicly against the coronavirus on December 21 but the Trumps' vaccinations had not been revealed previously. 

Trump, in a speech on Sunday, his first since leaving the White House, said everyone should get vaccinated against Covid-19, which has left more than 500,000 people dead in the United States. 

Some of Trump's supporters have expressed scepticism about being vaccinated. 

Trump came down with Covid-19 in early October and was hospitalised for several days in a suburb of Washington.
