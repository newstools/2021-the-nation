The suspects were killed by the mob at around 8.30pm when they were allegedly planning to carry out the burglary. 

During the foiled robbery, a watchman only identified as Peter was injured and rushed to Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital where he is recuperating.  

According to a police report obtained by Nation.Africa, the suspects arrived in a yellow motorcycle registration number KMEA 848N. 

Peter stopped the four and started questioning them and that’s when he was attacked by the suspects. 

“Upon integration, the four turned violent and stabbed him with a knife in the stomach injuring him seriously. He was rushed to Coast General Hospital by good samaritans and is undergoing treatment,” reads the police report. 

It is during the attack that another watchman, Aggrey Mukunzy, raised alarm which attracted members of the public, police say. 

“The thugs were cornered and subjected to mob justice where all four were fatally injured. The bodies were moved to Coast General Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem and identification,” reads the police report. 

Police said a motorcycle, a stained knife and hammer was recovered from the scene. The suspects were aged between 21 and 25 years-old.  Natala’s body bore various marks of injuries on its hands, legs, shoulders and neck. There are more than 100,000 illegal firearms in the hands of civilians in the region, officials say. The DP is facing a fresh political onslaught from, pro-BBI leaders keen to lock him out of their regions in the 2022 succession race. Mr Thakrar, 69, was suspended from the company he founded last month over claims of gross misconduct. The government is citing national security threats posed by some of the refugees.
