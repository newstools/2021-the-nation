GSU finished fifth in Africa in 2019 in Egypt where hosts Al-Ahly retained the title after sweeping aside compatriots Smouha 3-0 in the finals. 

GSU coach Gideon Tarus said they will certainly be a better side this time round even though they were yet to hit their peak.   

“On most occasions, we start well in the group stages and fade as the event takes shape but this time around, we want to get it right, and go all the way. The league matches have helped us notice our grey areas and we are working on them to seal the loopholes,” said Tarus. 






GSU are third on the National League log with 15 points from six matches behind leaders KPA who have 19 points from seven matches. Former champions Kenya Prisons are second with 17 points from seven matches. 

At the same time, KPA are excited about making their maiden appearance in Africa. 

KPA coach, Sammy Mulinge said they were hoping to start residential training next week ahead of the championship. 

Mulinge said Enock Mogeni, who is away in Sweden with club Sodertelge, will be available for selection. 

Mogeni was instrumental in KPA securing a championship slot during the 2019 league. 

“Currently, the Swedish league is at the play-off stage and if all goes well, Mogeni will be here on March 20 well ahead of our scheduled departure for the north African country,” said Mulinge.
