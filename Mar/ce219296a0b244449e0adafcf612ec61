She died at a city hospital where she had been admitted after contracting Covid-19.  

The mother of one was married to Edwin Macharia, and together they have a daughter.   

She will be interred tomorrow (Tuesday) at a private family function. However, her family has indicated that there will be a public virtual celebration of her life to be held at a later date. 

Career in media 

As a renown media personality, her name rekindles memories of popular 1990s TV game show Omo Pick-a-Box, the Vijana Tugutuke voting campaign and an upbeat, energetic and feisty young woman who was always ready to use her talents to champion a cause. 

Ms Irungu also hosted Club Kiboko for five years between 1994 and 1999, while also producing magazineshow Maisha and a youth talk show dubbed Niaje.  

She later hosted State of The Nation, a radio show at then-Nation FM. 

Survivor 

Ms Irungu was a lupus survivor, a long-term autoimmune disease, and was open about her struggles with it. She had also undergone three kidney transplants.

“I was diagnosed with lupus in my early twenties, which attacked my kidneys. I had my first kidney transplant in 1998. So far I have had three other transplants, the last one being in 2008,” she said while on an episode of Unscripted with Grace, which aired on NTV last year.

It all began with an infection that evolved into tuberculosis of the spine which saw her admitted to Nairobi Hospital.  

“I no longer had the will to fight. I was scarred physically and mentally. Frankly, I’d had enough of life and all it had to offer,” Irungu stated in a past interview with Daily Nation.  

But Irungu did decide to fight, with the help of a very giving family. Three times she has needed a kidney transplant, and three times her family members insisted on donating. First, her father donated, then her sister, and then her brother.

LORNA. Brilliant person. Well researched. She exchanged with decorum and countered differing views in a way that left you with fresh knowledge, I was lucky to be interviewed by her & to share a panel too. The angels will LOVE her company. To Family, God stretch His hand your way.— Dennis Itumbi, HSC (@OleItumbi) March 22, 2021  


Then I met Lorna Irungu in person when I was working at Storymoja and she was the loveliest, most encouraging person ever. She gave me one long talk about advocating for myself as a person living with Lupus and I've never forgotten. cc @mamayaimani— Lupus Awareness 🇰🇪 (@Sheblossoms) March 22, 2021  


So sad to hear of the passing of @KuisanMacharia From our first meeting at Phoenix in the early 90s she was always a trailblazer and a person to watch and learn from. Her battle with Lupus was bravely borne. We’ll miss you Lorna Irungu-Macharia. @edwin_macharia so sorry— Eric Wainaina (@EricWainaina) March 22, 2021
