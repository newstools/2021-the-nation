Over the past three or so years, the Kenyan government through KTB has held the role of title sponsor of the tournament now known as Magical Kenya Open by providing prize money. 

However in addition to that, KTB will still play a major role in this year’s tournament as well as the newly introduced Kenya Savannah Classic.

Making the official announcement for this year’s Magical Kenya Open and the Kenya Savannah Classic at the Nairobi National Park, KTB CEO Dr. Betty Radier said the sponsorship for the two European Tour (ET) events is a continuation of the support KTB has given to golf tournaments in the country. 

She said the agency’s sponsorship has also been extended to the Safari Tour golf series from which the Kenyan players participating in the two tournaments were selected from. The Magical Kenya Open is set for March 18 to 21 at Karen Country Club, while the Kenya Savannah Classic follows from March 23 to 26 at the same venue. 






Radier said that supporting and leveraging on sports is one of the long-term strategies that KTB is looking at to boost the country’s tourism sector. 

“Kenya is widely known for its prowess in sports especially in athletics, golf is now proving to be one of our major selling points as a destination. We therefore see an opportunity for the country’s tourism in this aspect which we shall continue to leverage on,” she said. 

The Magical Kenya Open which was elevated to be part of the elite European Tour in 2019 failed to take place in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The competition has for years been key to attracting top golf players and spectators, both local and international into the country each year thanks to its global audience.

The Kenya Savannah Classic was added to the list of European Tour events for 2021. The two events will be broadcasted to over 490 million homes globally and will locally be broadcasted to millions of households on free-to-air television. 

Radier noted that the addition of the Kenya Savannah Classic to this year’s list of the European Tour events is testament to the growing status of golf in the country, further adding that the events will increase confidence in the destination to travellers. 

“We thank the European Tour for finding it good to add us another event – the Kenya Savannah Classic, in addition to the Magical Kenya Open. This is proof enough that Kenya’s stature as a golfing destination is growing and it is also coming at a crucial moment as it will increase confidence in the destination among the travellers,” added Radier. 

KTB has meanwhile committed about Sh25 million towards activation of the two ET tournaments. This year, the events will be held under tight Covid-19 regulations which will include no fans and players being required to stay in a bubble during the entire period of the competitions.

Golf tourism is increasingly growing as one of the country’s top-selling points internationally. The destination is continually cementing its position as a top golfing destination in Africa, boasting over 40 golf class courses and a growing local and international fan base. 

In 2020, the country was named as Africa’s Best Golfing Destination by World Golf Awards, beating countries like Morocco, Egypt, and South Africa which are considered as the cream of Africa in golfing. 

At the same awards, Karen Country Club was declared as Kenya’s best golf course while the Great Rift Valley Country Lodge and Golf Resort located in Naivasha picked up the award for being the country’s best golf resort. 

Present during the function at the Nairobi National Park on Saturday were 12 local professionals who will be participating in the two European Tour events.
