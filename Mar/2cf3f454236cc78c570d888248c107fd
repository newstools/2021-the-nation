The DP yesterday met MPs to discuss the elections, how to maintain the “Hustler Nation” campaign in the face of the pandemic and recruiting members.  

“We are building a party from the grassroots. We will show our detractors and those who don’t like democracy that is it possible,” Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua said.  

Dr Ruto told members not to dwell on the recent by-election losses but focus on the 2022 General Election and building alliances. 

UDA  Secretary-General Veronica Maina said the party has identified interim officials and already has a constitution. 

“We invite members to familiarise themselves with the UDA constitution at http://www.uda.ke or at the party headquarters,” Ms Maina said.  

The party says it has identified volunteers who will assist in recruiting and registering members at county level.  

The volunteers will also identify constituency, ward and centre coordinators. 

“Coordinators must work with UDA members and leaders under the direction of the party headquarters,” Ms Maina said.  

Stop fighting  

Yesterday, Dr Ruto asked lawmakers and other leaders to stop fighting.  

In Nakuru, a faction led by Senator Susan Kihika and another under Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri are battling for the control of UDA. At the centre of the storm is who should be the regional coordinator. 

Senator Kihika’s group is fronting former Rongai parliamentary hopeful Paul Chebor while the other faction prefers Mr Ngunjiri’s daughter Edith Kimani. 

“UDA has not conducted elections yet Mr Ngunjiri wants to install his daughter as the county co-ordinator,” Mr Chebor told the Nation by phone.

“He does not want to listen to members. We’ll not allow Mr Ngunjiri to meddle with the affairs of UDA.” 

However, Mr Ngunjiri downplayed the divisions. 

“UDA is very strong in Nakuru. The few teething problems will be addressed properly very soon,” said Mr Ngunjiri, who is also the chairman of Nakuru county lawmakers.  

“Let members remain calm and united. Peace should be our top priority. When we announced that there would be coordinators, it was perhaps understood wrongly. We have not even launched the party.” 

The Bahati MP said UDA wants to create and maintain peace in Nakuru as the country heads to the General Election next year.  

Party wrangles 

“I have made it clear that our main objective is to unite Kenyans. It is unfortunate when some people feel they have been left out,” he said.  

Efforts to reach Senator Kihika were futile as she did not respond to calls and text messages. 

Several members have left a local WhatsApp group called “Nakuru UDA Coordination WhatsApp” following bitter exchanges between the two factions. 

The wrangles come barely a month after the party won the London ward by-election. 

UDA candidate Anthony Nzuki beat 18 rivals, including Jubilee’s Francis Njoroge. 

The senator and Mr Ngunjiri have been positioning themselves as influencers of UDA politics in Nakuru, each seeking to win Dr Ruto’s approval. 

Ms Kihika has announced intention to contest the Nakuru governor seat. 

The two were considered enemies long before the 2013 General Election but they later reconciled, thanks to Dr Ruto.

They again fell out though they are in the Deputy President’s camp.   The DP is facing a fresh political onslaught from, pro-BBI leaders keen to lock him out of their regions in the 2022 succession race. With at least 121 MPs loyal to the Tangatanga camp, the pro-impeachment team would have to lure at least five legislators to tilt the balance in the House. Two critical Health ministry agencies clueless as it emerges that Sputnik V is already available in some private hospitals in Kenya. Deputy President claims Jubilee is being turned into a tribal grouping. The whereabouts of the domestic helper who was with the five is still yet to established.
