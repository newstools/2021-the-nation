Nigeriaâ€™s inflation rose to a four-year high of more than 17 percent in February, while a rise in joblessness left a third of the workforce unemployed at the end of 2020, the statistics office said Tuesday. 

Year-on-year inflation was 17.33 percent in February after 16.47 percent in January, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said, blaming increases in the cost of food.

The NBS also said Nigeria's unemployment rate rose to 33.3 percent in the three months through December, up from 27.1 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the last period the agency released labour-force statistics. 

Food prices rose last month, especially for beef, after traders in northern Nigeria suspended deliveries to the populous south in protest at alleged killings and harassment of their kinsmen. The blockade has since been lifted.

} The central bank says it is also imposing restrictions on hard currency movements. It is now cheaper by up to Sh30 per litre for a Kenyan motorist to buy fuel in Dar es Salaam than in Nairobi. Isuzu EA has maintained that the bus never left its showroom. Andayi says it was unfortunate that the NLC official died under mysterious circumstances. Motorists from Kisii, Homa Bay and Migori counties are using porous borders to access neighbouring country.
