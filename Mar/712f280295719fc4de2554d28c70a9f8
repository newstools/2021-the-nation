In August last year, President Salva Kiir ordered his country's aviation authorities to promptly investigate a plane crash that left eight people dead, according to South Sudan’s Red Cross. 

The order came after a chartered plane belonging to South West Aviation Company crashed shortly after taking off from Juba International Airport.
