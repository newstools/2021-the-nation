“I am very humbled by this distinct honour to appoint me to the Board of the Olympic Refugee Foundation to join other eminent members and to add my voice, experience and passion to enable this program scale up and attain its noble goals,” said Tergat, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. 

He hailed the appointment as another positive cap for Kenya, whose athletes continue to provide positive branding and profile for the nation globally, hence underscoring sports as a strong marketing platform. 






Tergat said that he is not new to such roles having served as a goodwill ambassador against hunger for the World Food Program in 2014. 

“Among those people (displaced) are great future world leaders and game-changers,” he said.
