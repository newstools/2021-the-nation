Egypt, who top Group 'G' of the 2021 Afcon qualifiers with eight points, will face-off with third-placed Harambee Stars in Nairobi on March 25, before welcoming Comoros, who are also on eight points, on March 29. 

Having amassed three points so far, Harambee Stars face an uphill task of making an immediate return to the continental showpiece after gracing the 2019 edition held in Egypt. 

In their last match of the qualifiers, Harambee Stars under the tutelage of Jacob “Ghost” Mulee will square it out with Togo in Lome on March 29. 






Local-based Harambee Stars players have intensified their preparations of the two important matches with friendly matches against Bright Stars of South Sudan and Taifa Stars of Tanzania. 

Coach Mulee’s charges beat Bright Stars 1-0 last Saturday at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi, before seeing off Taifa Stars 2-1 on Monday at the same venue. 

A second friendly match between Harambee Stars and Taifa Stars, which was planned for Thursday at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi at the same venue was cancelled following the untimely demise of Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli on Wednesday night. 

Coach Mulee is yet to name his squad of foreign based players for the two matches.
