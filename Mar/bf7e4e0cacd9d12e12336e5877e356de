The coronation of National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi as the Mt Kenya East region spokesman by Meru, Embu and Kikuyu elders on Saturday has unsettled politicians from the region, with many terming the move as inconsequential. 

The endorsement of Mr Muturi by Meru’s Njuri Ncheke elders comes days after he was picked by Embu and Mbeere elders a few days ago. It also set the pace for another endorsement by the Kikuyu community elders in the coming days.

Among the leaders who have faulted the coronation include Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya and MPs Maore Maoka (Igembe North) and Kathuri Murungi (Imenti South). 

‘A cultural event’ 

While Speaker Muturi and the elders maintained that the coronation was not a political but a cultural move, the event was layered with political undertones. 

Mr Muturi entered the Njuri Ncheke shrine in Nchiru mobbed by Embu and Mbeere elders, who handed him over to the Ameru elders for the ceremony.

});

Njuri Ncheke’s director of culture, Silas Gitiye, who led the coronation process, started off by recounting how Mt Kenya east region has stood by their kin in the west since independence, including Jomo Kenyatta, Mwai Kibaki and Uhuru Kenyatta. 

“We have celebrated with our kin from the other side of the mountain whenever they give birth. Now that we have given birth to a leader, they should celebrate with us. Mr Muturi has been picked just like a farmer handpicks the best seed for planting. This is the seed that we will plant when the time comes,” Mr Gitiye said. 

Mr Muturi was then given a spear, a sword and shield, with the elders declaring him the de facto spokesperson of the region. 

Kikuyu elders next 

Mr Kung’u Muigai, the patron of Kiama Kia Ma, said the Kikuyu elders would soon receive Speaker Muturi and bless him.

});
}, 62000);
}




“We thank Mt Kenya East residents for standing by us since independence. There have been complaints that the mountain grows taller after every election but we promise that this will not happen again,” Mr Muigai said. 

CS Munya, who attended the meeting, said while he was not informed of the key event, the National Assembly Speaker was welcome to visit the elders. 

“We will meet later and see whether he came through the right or wrong channels. However, our culture does not allow us to reject a visitor,” Mr Munya said. 

He added that during the Sagana meeting, they agreed that they would meet again to chart the way forward for the region after the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is endorsed. 

‘Coronation unnecessary’ 

Mr Maore termed the Speaker’s coronation as "unfortunate, misguided and unnecessary". 

“We recently met in Sagana and I do not remember us leaving any gap for Speaker Muturi to fill. President Uhuru Kenyatta is still the spokesman of the Mt Kenya region. This is an unnecessary move especially when we are trying to drum support for the Building Bridges Initiative,” Mr Maoka said. 

He accused the speaker of sneaking into Meru without the blessings of the local elected leaders. 






“Meeting the elders without the company of the elected leaders is not coronation but an initiation. We are still waiting for the direction of the president at the right time and this would have been after the BBI. This will end up with a lot of disappointment,” the MP said.

No leadership vacuum 

Mr Maore’s sentiments were backed by James Mithika, a politician from Igembe Central, who insisted that the region does not have a leadership vacuum. 

He said the coronation of the National Assembly Speaker as the Mt Kenya East spokesperson was insignificant as he lacked the support of elected leaders. 

“How many MPs, MCAs or governors were with him? We only have one kingpin in Mt Kenya and that is Uhuru Kenyatta. Anything else is just sideshows. Muturi’s coronation was just a Njuri Ncheke affair,” Mr Mithika said. 

In a Facebook post on his official page, the South Imenti MP said the Speaker had not used the right channels in seeking the blessings of Njuri Ncheke. 

Elected leaders not involved 

“Almost 99 per cent of Ameru elected leaders are Njuri Ncheke elders but they were not involved in the coronation of Speaker Muturi. Every community in the Mt Kenya East should pick their spokesperson from where the regional kingpin can be identified from the three leaders,” he said. 

“The name spokesperson can have different meanings. Maybe Speaker Muturi is Njuri Ncheke’s spokesman. Meru and Tharaka Nithi political leaders who are elected by the residents were never involved. Anything done in the dark is out of order,” added Mr Kathuri.

The MP said despite Mr Muturi holding a senior position in government, he has not used his influence to address issues in the region. 

“If you haven’t done anything in the last nine years, what will you give in the last days in office? I cannot support the coronation,” Mr Kathuri said. 

The MP said extensive consultations are needed among the Ameru leaders to identify the rightful heir of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the region.
