Justice Mwilu said the order followed a structural inspection by the the State Department of Public Works two weeks ago, on the invitation of Kericho Law Courts’ leadership. 

“The investigation report highlighted structural flaws arising from modifications to the building that were undertaken in 2014,” Justice Mwilu said in a statement on Friday. 






She noted that the Judiciary has tremendously improved infrastructure but that many courts in the country are still dilapidated. 

The Judiciary has appealed to the government and Parliament for funds for the construction of the Kericho courts and other facilities in the country. 

“We are already engaging with relevant parliamentary committees on providing adequate funding and increasing the Judiciary’s development vote for renovations and construction of new court stations across the country,” Justice Mwilu stated. 

Officials meet 

On March 1, Kericho marked the building as condemned and directed evacuation of the occupants. 

On Friday, Judiciary Chief Registrar Anne Atieno Amadi on Friday inspected the condemned building and held a meeting with Resident Judge Assenath Ongeri, Justice Mary Oundu of the Employment and Labour Relations Court, Kericho County Attorney Gideon Mutai and members of the Court Users Association.

The officials then toured facilities proposed for use as temporary courts as the structural issues in the courts building are addressed. 

Kericho County courts are complete but have not been used. A children’s rehabilitation centre near the police divisional headquarters has been proposed for use as a temporary court but a final decision has not been made. 

A majority of the members of the Court Users Association said the Judiciary should demolish the building and construct a modern one with all the requirements. 

Ms Amadi and her team are expected in Kericho on March 19 to review the matter and  meet Governor Paul Chepkwony. The construction work was to be done in three months, between March and May 2013. She said the cost of court construction projects is likely to go higher if funding is delayed or their budgets cut. He is accused of attacking an IEBC officer during the by-election on Thursday.
