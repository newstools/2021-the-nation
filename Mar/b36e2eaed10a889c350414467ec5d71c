Two African countries — Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — have reported 29 Ebola virus cases and 13 deaths so far, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said Saturday. 

Africa CDC, the specialised healthcare agency of the 55-member African Union, reported a fatality rate of 45 per cent in the two countries.

So far, DRC has reported 11 cases, four deaths and two recoveries, while Guinea has confirmed 18 cases, nine deaths and two recoveries, it said. 

New outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus disease in the two African countries are sending new jitters to Africa as the continent is still grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak claimed over 11,300 lives, with over 28,600 recorded cases. 

Ebola is a highly contagious haemorrhagic fever that causes a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, generalised pain or malaise and in many cases internal and external bleeding. According to the Africa CDC, neither of the Ebola virus-affected countries has so far reported recoveries. On February 7, the DR Congo said a resurgence of the virus had been identified in an eastern part of the country. Orengo claims the civil servants have already declared who will rule the country after President Kenyatta. Findings show quicker decrease in viral load among individuals with early-stage Covid-19 who are treated with molnupiravir.
