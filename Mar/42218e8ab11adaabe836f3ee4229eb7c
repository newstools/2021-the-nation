‘‘I recommend [the vaccine] to all eligible Nigerians so that we can be protected from the virus,’’ he said. 

He urged all State governments, traditional and religious leaders and other people of influence to lead mobilisation efforts. 

‘‘The vaccine offers hope for a safe country free from the coronavirus,” he said. 

‘‘I urge all eligible Nigerians to present themselves and be vaccinated, in accordance with the order of priority already mapped out, at designated centres only,’’ he added. 

Use of resources 

President Buhari thanked governments, donors, development partners, the private sector, traditional and religious leaders  and other stakeholders who have supported Nigeria’s response to the pandemic, assuring that all the resources will be equitably administered.

He noted that since the beginning of the year 2020, humanity has remained under the burden of the pandemic, “an unseen but very potent enemy around the world”. 

‘‘The virus has resulted in over 2.5 million fatalities and destroyed several global and national systems,” he said. 

‘‘The response in Nigeria and the Ecowas sub-region has been robust, collaborative and united. It was driven by a collective knowledge of the fact that no country is safe until every country is safe. 

‘‘The speedy development of vaccines is quite significant and underscores the collective resolve of humanity to overcome the pandemic. Similarly, the collaborative effort to ensure equal access has brought relief to poor and developing countries.” 

The President further said the government will roll out a vaccine administration plan that will see over 70 per cent of Nigeria’s population inoculated by 2022. 

Huge population 

The country had a population of at least 206 million by 2020, according to data from the United Nations. 

Nigeria received its first batch of the vaccines through Covax on March 2, when they were delivered at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport in Abuja. The vaccine will be administered in two doses. 

The government is expecting 129 million vaccine doses to vaccinate 70 per cent of its population within two years.

With more than 150,000 Nigerians infected with the virus and more than 1,800 lives lost, the path to recovery for the people of Nigeria can finally begin, said Mr Peter Hawkins, Unicef’s Country Representative for Nigeria. 

“This is a very significant occasion. The arrival of the Covid-19 vaccines into Nigeria is critical in curbing the pandemic. The only way out of this crisis is to ensure that vaccinations are available to all.”  

Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of Nigeria’s National Council for Disease Control (NCDC), reported that the nation has finished making preparations for vaccine administration as well as an impact assessment. 

 “Amidst the difficulties in the last one year, we must use lessons from the pandemic to prepare for future outbreaks, or else history will not judge us kindly,” he said. 

 “As we work towards an important milestone this week, that will require our collaboration, we‘ll continue to work in solidarity with our sister agency and all our partners to ensure a successful vaccination campaign.”   Rwanda plans to vaccinate 30 per cent of its population by the end of 2021 and 60 per cent by the end of 2022. Recipients expected to to for the second vaccine eight weeks after the first, Health ministry says. Reports of a rift in the team are "propaganda", says secretariat co-chair Dennis Waweru. Tanzania says it has not received official communication from Kenya on a maize imports ban.
