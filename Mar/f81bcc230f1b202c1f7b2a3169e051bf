A statement from State House in the Isles said that the appointment of Mr Masoud, who is a member of the opposition party ACT-Wazalendo, was in accordance with Article 9 (3) of the Zanzibar Constitution which requires the President to maintain the spirit of the Government of National Unity (GNU). 

“And following powers vested on him through Article 39(4) of the Zanzibar Constitution of 1984 and after consultations with ACT-Wazalendo, the President of Zanzibar and chairman of the Revolutionary Council Dr Hussein Ali Mwinyi has appointed Mr Othman Masoud Othman Sharif to be the First Vice President,” reads part of the press statement.

Earlier on Monday, Dr Mwinyi had promised to issue an important announcement while speaking to journalists. Journalists in Zanzibar told the President that State House statements were released late, therefore denying print and television stations the opportunity to make extensive coverage on major issues. 

“I have heard your concerns. In that regard I have to leave here earlier because later today there will be an important announcement to share with you,” he told the cheering members of the media. 

Speaking during an interview with local media earlier on Monday, March 1, 2021, ACT-Wazalendo Party Leader Mr Zitto Kabwe said the name of the person to succeed the late Hamad had been submitted to President Mwinyi who is the appointing authority.

“The candidate conforms with the party's criteria of advocating reconciliation and unity,” he said. Among them are Zanzibar’s First Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad and former Bank of Tanzania Governor Benno Ndulu. He becomes the first person to publicly reveal a coronavirus status in Tanzania. Some members of his family have been campaigning discreetly, while others have come out in the open. Simon Muchiri is in trouble after posting messages about President Kenyatta on his Facebook page. The party's new deputy secretary-general position is Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny.
