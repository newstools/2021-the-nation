US designations 

Last Wednesday, the US Department of State designated two affiliates of ISIS operating in Mozambique and the DR Congo as Foreign Terrorist Organisations in a move meant to cut off supplies to the groups and restrict their leaders. 

In a statement, the Department said ISIS-Mozambique and ISIS-DRC are Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) and that their leaders, Abu Yasir Hassan and Seka Musa Baluku, are terror merchants. 

Since October 2017, ISIS-Mozambique, led by Abu Yasir Hassan, has been linked to the killing of more than 1,300 civilians. Abu Yasir Hassan is said to be a Tanzanian national leading a militant insurgency in gas-rich Mozambique. A jihadist group has caused havoc in gas-rich Cabo Delgado over the last three years, beheading people and torching villages.
