NSE Chief Executive Officer, Mr Geoffrey Odundo said through 30 Per Cent Club campaign, the bourse is encouraging listed firms to include women in boards and senior management. 

“Why are we doing this? We have done research and the studies have shown that (firms) with women on boards have excellent results,” he said. 

The Club, which NSE joined two weeks ago, was established in the UK in 2010 by British financier Dame Helena Morrissey and champions for gender-balanced boards and senior management in corporates across the globe. 

Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), Chief Executive Officer, Ms Phyllis Wakiaga said: “For manufacturers (what this study means is that) we will have to consider women more as we develop our products, brand and market our products.” 

Empowerment initiatives 

“We also need to take the insights of women more seriously…really involve them in decision making processes in the manufacturing sector,” she added. 

Chief Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Public Service and Gender, Ms Rachel Shebesh, said the data will inform the State’s women empowerment initiatives especially in training women to invest affirmative funds in market-driven ventures.
