The recent by-elections in various parts of the country offered us a display of how the Executive showcases its role in contemporary governance. Granted, the Executive as the domicile of the security apparatus and executive muscle is traditionally powerful. 

In our time, however, this arm has rapidly grown into a monstrosity devouring the executive mandates of counterpart arms. The resultant behemoth totally dominates government and subordinates the others, reducing the majority of them to mere clerical functions.

Once the reviled lair of the president’s administrative nemeses, the Office of the President, for instance, has installed itself right in the centre of power as the biggest, heaviest and most devastating blunt political weapon in the land. 

The Executive’s disaffection with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 is well documented. As Kenya prepared to go into the 2010 referendum, for instance, desperate securocrats commandeered the Government Press to introduce a “national security” clawback into the draft constitution, obviously intending to throw the plebiscite into disarray. They failed, but were in no way discouraged. 






Executive autonomy 

 Afterwards, its functionaries used all opportunities to declaim their views of the constitution as inimical to effective government. 

In other words, the Executive’s perennial reason for flagrant noncompliance with the constitution is that the constitution itself is antithetical to effective administration of the country. It is the law which should comply with OP, not vice versa. 

OP’s chief grouse is that the frameworks of checks and balances, accountability and oversight by legislative and judicial arms, commissions and independent offices as well as the broad regime of rights-based and citizen-centred governance takes away executive autonomy and saddles government with onerous responsibilities.

OP’s theory is that good governance requires effective administration, which can only be achieved through the deployment of violence to secure citizen compliance with government policies and programmes. 

Anything short of that is insultingly deficient and unworthy of the term “government”. This notion of governance is inherently colonial, whereas the 2010 Constitution entails an intentionally radical decolonising agenda. Some policies reprise colonial terror at its most diabolical: torture, arson, forceful displacement, extrajudicial killings, severe restriction of freedoms and wanton, violent abuse. The great ministry views the country as a vast concentration camp with natives to be shouted at, hounded and battered for the sake of ‘good government’. 

This needs to be understood for a proper appreciation of the OP’s attitude of utter disaffection with the constitutional status quo. Its disdain is plain and its resistance resolute. 

Consider, therefore, the disgust that the decolonisation agenda has elicited in Government Square.  Article 4 of the Constitution locates national values and principles of governance set out in Article 10 as the foundation of our Republic. 

Article 10 declares the values as absolutely binding to everyone who wants their actions to be deemed constitutional and legitimate. Among these values, the rule of law, participation of the people, human dignity, equality, human rights, integrity, transparency and accountability must particularly gall our “colonial office” most of all.

Impunity 

It is starkly ironic that the rapid mutation of an already muscular OP into this all-consuming monster occurred during the term of the inaugural administration of the new constitutional dispensation. Without a doubt, the stupendous transmogrification of the OP is a reaction to the constitution. 

As government found its feet, OP recalibrated itself to overturn and neutralise all progress and gains in order to incrementally deligitimise the constitution and ultimately overthrow it. Thus would the colonial approach to administration be restored. 

This explains OP’s persistently anti-constitutional institutional posture, and its brazen propensity for official impunity. An outraged Law Society of Kenya has echoed retired Chief Justice David Maraga’s despairing lamentation of government’s impunity in disobeying court orders. 

On the other hand, the Cabinet secretary in charge of the OP has come out to embolden the system in this impunity by publicly declaring that court orders which the government does not like will simply be disregarded. 

Yet the impunity extends beyond mere noncompliance with judicial sanctions. There is a firm policy for OP to fully reconstitute itself as an extraconstitutional mandate whose objective is to restore robust executive lawlessness.

In 2020, the Executive led the charge as state machinery was deployed to commit arson, abduction, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, abuse and molestation of citizens, activists and legislators, the demolition of dwellings, destruction of food crops and violent suppression of peaceful assemblies and processions. 

The mandate to manage the Covid-19 pandemic was recharacterised as a policing, not medical issue, and reassigned from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of the Interior. The Ministry of Health today remains a diffident announcer of statistics. 

@EricNgeno The DP made the announcement shortly after President Uhuru Kenyatta banned all political gatherings for 30 days. The President has also announced that funerals will take place 72 hours after confirmation of death. This was the President's 14th address on the Covid-19 pandemic in kenya, and the first one in 2021.
