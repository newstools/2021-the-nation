Nyali Golf & Country Club has joined the growing list of organisations that have embraced clean solar power after it signed a lease with Redavia, a multinational solar energy provider. 

According to the deal, Redavia will provide cost-efficient and renewable energy under a flexible lease contract. This will enable the club to save on energy cost while enjoying reliable supply throughout. In addition, Redavia’s carbon neutral solution will enable the club to reduce its carbon footprint.

Speaking at the annual Chairman’s Cup held at the golf club, the chairman, Mr Taib Bajaber, said he was “pleased to be part of the team steering this partnership between the club and Redavia. This will see the club achieve its objectives of cost-cutting and sustainability”. 

Mr Taib said the club, which is considered as the home of golf on Kenya’s Coast, and is known for hosting highly rated tournaments and events all year round, is keen on environmental conservation and cost-efficiency while still providing high class services to its members and impacting the community around the facility.

It is easy to ship, set up, scale, and redeploy. Businesses benefit from a cost-effective, reliable, clean energy solution with minimal upfront investment. The new Café Deli along Koinange Street in Nairobi is one of the businesses that have embraced solar energy. The firm says it has installed some 3,390 solar panels and is planning to have an additional 41 stations migrate to solar energy by next year. Stop the squabbling and focus on the big picture, President Kenyatta tells leaders of six political parties. An old and dusty facility sitting on the heels of a footbridge crossing over multitudes of old and rusty train containers, NMC lacks the pomp and colour associated with State corporations. The politicians said they are facing persecution for rejecting the outcome of the October 2020 polls.
