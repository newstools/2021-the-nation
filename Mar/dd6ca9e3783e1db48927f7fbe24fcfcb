The Kenyan international opened the scores just before the break to end a goal-drought of three matches.

Abdullah Al Ahrak doubled Al Duhail's lead six minutes from time with a nicely curled long-range shot. 

For Olunga - the 2020 J1 League top scorer and Most Valuable Player - goals have been hard to come by in Qatar. 

He has played 10 matches ( four in the top league and two each at the Fifa Club World Cup, Amir Cup and Qatar Cup) since January 12 when he joined Sabri Lamouchi's side from Kashiwa Reysol. 






 Although he has netted five times, most have been in cup competitions. His first three being against Al Ahli Doha in the 6-0 demolition in the Amir Cup Round of 16 on January 25.  

The centre-forward, who turns 27 on March 26, then scored his only league goal so far in a 2-0 win over Al Rayyan on February 14.  

He tops the scoring in Amir Cup with four goals. His closest rivals in this competition are Hashim Ali Abdullatif and Yusuf Abdurisag who both grabbed a brace in Al Sadd's 7-0 mauling of Muaither in the round of 16.
