Angachi was instrumental in the middle of the pack for Gaspo in February where she provided an assist in each of the three games besides providing cover for her defense. 

Gaspo beat Makolanders 4-0, Ulinzi 2-1 and Mathare United Women 2-0 in February. It is her dazzling show in the matches that convinced her fellow players to vote her as the most outstanding player for February. 

The Harambee Starlets player garnered 24 votes to beat Kayole Starlets’ Christine Ngoizi (18) to theaward. Kibera Soccer Ladies’ Lucy Stella and Kayole Starlet defender Juliet Auma had 14 votes apiece to tie for third place.
