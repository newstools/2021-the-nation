Kiambu County on Monday started vaccinating its frontline health workers against Covid-19 as part of the national inoculation campaign that began last week. 

The county has so far registered 7,000 cases of the coronavirus disease, including 27 infections at a primary school last week. 

Health Chief Officer Patrick Nyaga said on Monday that the county has received  13,500 doses of the vaccine and hopes to conclude the exercise within two days, depending on the number of people who go for vaccination.

The country has received its first shipment of about a million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. 

Dr Nyaga was the first person in the county to be vaccinated  at Thika Level Five Hospital. 

Speaking after launching the exercise that saw tens of healthcare workers travel from various sub-counties to be vaccinated, Kirinyaga’s Health executive Joseph Murega said vaccination will take place at Thika and Kiambu level five hospitals due to the large number of health workers there.

Mr Murega warned against the sale of vaccines, noting it is free of charge. 

He also cautioned residents against dropping their guard and failing to adhere to basic measures in the fight against the virus, which include washing hands and maintaining physical distance. 

“This is a novel virus so we do not know how it can change. We started with one variant but there are now many, which attack the body differently. We must remain vigilant by observing all the measures as stipulated by the Ministry of Health,” said Mr Murega 

 “It is not a joke and we are now battling a third wave,” he also said, and advised the public to also exercise, eat balanced meals and get vaccinated.
