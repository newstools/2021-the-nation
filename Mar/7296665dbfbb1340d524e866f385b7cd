It has been one year since the coronavirus pandemic that occasioned many changes was confirmed in the country, and only photos can best help us recount the year that was.    A click. A tick. A clock. A camera. 

While all are parameters used to denote time and space, once upon a time, photos told the story of changing times and photography was just about capturing a moment in time and space.  

Then 2020 happened. And the parameters changed too. Time was counted in lockdown days, and space, measured in increment of more than 1.5 metres apart.
