Cause of fire 

A student who did not want to be named said the fire might have been caused by some students who have been complaining about the schools’ 'poor' management. 

The school’s principal, Mr Daniel Mwasombo, declined to speak to the media about the incident. 

Education officials, led by County Director of Education, Philip Chirchir, assessed the damage and agreed together with the school board of management to send all the 930 students home.

They said that some of the students had been forced to spend the night in classroom while others shared bed with others following the fire.  

The officials also said police have launched a probe into the incident to ascertain the cause of the fire.  

Schools’ unrest 

The incident is the second one to happen after students tried to set the dorm a blaze in January but their plans were thwarted by prefects. 

One parent of a Form Four student in the school said parents are now uncertain of how the candidates will perform in the KCSE exams which are due to begin this month.
