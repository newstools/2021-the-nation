Nakuru has the highest number of potential investors, including Cactus Ventures, Digiera Logistics Enterprises Ltd, Mabati and Steel Enterprises, Buffloc Investment, Metro Contractors, Trigger Agencies and Suppliers Ltd and Sepima Ltd. 

Others are Apex Resort, Kester Kenya Ltd, Barebone Company, Bahati Africa Ltd, Gatke International Ltd, Ng'awam Ltd, Bonzo Investment Ltd, Mwachecom General Construction Ltd, Kika One Sixty Five Ltd, Regence Enterprises, Utugi Enterprises, Eserian Ltd and Donfab Enterprises Ltd. 

Mr Kamau Njuguna, a director representing Kenya in the East Africa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the interest is a clear indication that Nakuru is the most preferred investment destination in the country. 

"Governor Lee Kinyanjuiâ€™s administration should use the goodwill by the investors to fast-track the upgrade of infrastructure, health, and water services in the region as the demand for these services will peak in the next five years as more investors troop to Naivasha," said Mr Kamau.
