South African club Mamelodi Sundowns ended the 74-match unbeaten home record in African competitions of Democratic Republic of Congo team TP Mazembe with a 2-1 CAF Champions League victory Saturday.  

While Sundowns celebrated, title-holders Al Ahly of Egypt were held 2-2 at home by V Club of DR Congo, keeping them third in Group A and raising doubts as to whether they can reach the quarter-finals.

Runaway Group C leaders Wydad Casablanca of Morocco beat closest rivals Horoya of Guinea 2-0 via Ayoub el Kaabi and Simon Msuva goals, leaving them and Sundowns as the only sides with perfect three-win records.      

Sundowns set-piece specialist Lyle Lakay scored direct from a free-kick with 20 seconds of regular time remaining to earn the Pretoria outfit a famous triumph in southern Congolese city Lubumbashi. 






Namibian Peter Shalulile put 2016 African champions Sundowns ahead on 67 minutes as Mazembe players appealed for offside in a spectator-less stadium due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

Veteran Tresor Mputu, widely regarded as one of the greatest African footballers never to play in Europe, levelled on 82 minutes by punishing defensive hesitancy from Mosa Lebusa.   

"We prepared extremely well for this match against great opponents," Sundowns joint head coach Manqoba Mngqithi told AFP after becoming the first South African club to win in Lubumbashi. 

"The boys entered the match brimming with confidence born out of going 22 domestic and international matches without defeat since last October." 

Five-time African champions Mazembe last lost a home CAF match in October 2009, going down 2-0 to Al Hilal of Sudan in a Champions League semi-final.

The Ravens won 61 matches since, drew 13, scored 166 goals and conceded 34 in Champions League, Confederation Cup and Super Cup matches before facing Sundowns. 

Good day for South Africa 

Success took Sundowns to a maximum nine points from three matches at the halfway stage in Group B while Mazembe, Hilal and CR Belouizdad of Algeria have two each. 

On a good day for South Africa, third-place Kaizer Chiefs won for the first time in Group C with goals from Eric Mathoho and Happy Mashiane delivering a 2-0 victory over Angolan visitors Petro Atletico.  

In Cairo, Ahly lacked winger Mahmoud Kahraba -- suspended for one month and fined $12,500 (10,500 euros) after clashing with coach Pitso Mosimane -- as they trailed and led before securing only one point. 

Makadi Lilepo gave the Kinshasa outfit a half-time lead, substitutes Mohamed Sherif and Marwan Mohsen scored within two minutes to turn the tide, but Ricky Tulengi levelled from an 80th-minute penalty. 

Surprise Group A frontrunners Simba of Tanzania followed up a home win over record nine-time champions Ahly by drawing 0-0 with Al Merrikh of Sudan in Omdurman and lead V Club and Ahly by three points. 

Merrikh, bottom of the table with just one point from three outings, sacked Tunisian coach Nasreddine Nabi after the match.

Zamalek, who lost to Ahly in an all-Egyptian 2020 Champions League final, had Ahmed el Fatouh sent off on 58 minutes after being yellow-carded twice as they fell 3-1 away to Esperance of Tunisia. 

El Fatouh cancelled a goal by Ivorian William Togai before Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane scored on the stroke of half-time and again early in the second half for the Tunis club. 

Esperance top Group D with seven points, Mouloudia Alger of Algeria have five after a 1-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Teungueth of Senegal, and Zamalek only two.
