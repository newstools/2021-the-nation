All the 363 MPs gave their approval shortly after Dr Mpango’s name was presented to Speaker of Parliament, Mr Job Ndugai, by the President’s aide-de-camp earlier in the day. 

Dr Mpango will be sworn-in on Wednesday at  the State House in Chamwino, Dodoma. 

Following his confirmation, Dr Mpango ceases to be a member of Parliament as spelt out in the Constitution. 

“I therefore wish to inform the National Electoral Commission that the Buhigwe Constituency seat is now vacant,” said Mr Ndugai.
