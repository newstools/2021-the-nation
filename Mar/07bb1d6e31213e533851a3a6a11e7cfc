Mr Polepole said the central committee stated that in the near future, there will be a special general meeting to approve President Hassan as CCM chairperson. 

"This meeting should be organised and held soon. As is our custom, the general meeting is preceded by a meeting of the central council to fill the vacancy," he said. 

Though he did not mention issues apart from the funeral of the late President, among the pressing issues the party has to deal with is the position of Vice President, which Ms Hassan held under President Magufuli. He expressed hope for President Hassan's success, noting she had been serving as Vice President. Mourners lined the streets of Dar es Salaam to bid farewell to President, some of them weeping and throwing flower petals as the casket.
