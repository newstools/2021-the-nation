Slaps, blows, kicks and arrests dominated the by-elections held yesterday as the high stakes placed on the mini-polls brought out the worst of politicians and their supporters. 

The presence of lawmakers allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto, Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetangula and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) chief Raila Odinga signified the importance of the elections as each attempts to upstage the other ahead of the General Election next year.

Voters also lost shirts, money, trousers and other belongings in the skirmishes that also drew condemnation from the electoral agency and the Media Council of Kenya. 

Violence was mostly witnessed in the high-stakes elections in Kabuchai constituency in Bungoma county, Matungu constituency in Kakamega, Kiamokama ward in Kisii County and the London Ward elections in Nakuru County.

However, the by-elections in Huruma Ward in Uasin Gishu and Kitise-Kithuki in Makueni were relatively peaceful. 

Pandemic reality 

But low voter turnout and failure of gadgets also characterised the by-elections. 

The coronavirus pandemic reality was evident, with the IEBC insisting that anyone without a face mask would not be allowed into a voting station. 

Residents queuing up to vote had to wash their hands at designated places and thereafter. IEBC officials took their temperature.

In Matungu, police arrested Mr Malala's bodyguard and are looking for former Mr Echesa for assaulting an IEBC official. 

Mr Echesa was captured on a video beating up the man at Bulonga Primary School polling station. 

Kakamega County Police Commander Hassan Barua said the hunt for Mr Echesa was on. 

Police officers raided Mr Echesa's home in Shibale but did not find him. 

IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati condemned the assault and called for Mr Echesa's arrest and prosecution. 

At Munami polling station, a pistol owned by Mr Malala’s bodyguard was confiscated by police officers after the shooting of a man as voting progressed. The man was taken to hospital. 

Mr Malala, who was accompanied by a group of youths had earlier stormed the polling station saying IEBC officials were watching as ODM agents stuffed ballot boxes. 

Police say the senator's bodyguard drew a pistol and shot at a group of young men who were pelting the senator's vehicle with stones.

Voting delayed 

"I'm not under arrest. I'm visiting the station. You can see I'm not in handcuffs," Mr Ong'ondo said. 

Earlier, Kakamega Woman representative Elsie Muhanda fled from a group of youths who pelted her vehicle with stones. 

At several polling centres, the Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System (KIEMS) failed to detect fingerprints, delaying the voting. 

IEBC cleared 15 people to contest the Matungu parliamentary seat. They include Peter Nabulindo (ANC), Mr David Were (ODM), Mr Alex Lanya (United Democratic Alliance), Mr Charles Kasamani (United Democratic Party), Ms Auma Faida (Maendeleo Chap Chap) and Mr Paul Achayo (Movement for Democracy and Growth). 

Mr Bernard Wakoli, Mr Athman Wangara, Ms Christabel Amunga, Mr Anzelimo Kongoti, Mr Eugene Ambwere, Mr Samuel Munyekenye, Mr Kevin Nector, Mr Wilberforce Lutta and Mr Gregory Atoko were cleared to run as independent candidates. 

Ms Amunga is the wife of former MP Justus Murunga while Mr Ambwere is his son. 

Mr Murunga died late last year, precipitating the by-election. 

In Kabuchai, four MPs were arrested on their way to Chwele as Ford Kenya and UDA officials accused each other of attempting to rig the elections. 

While allies of Deputy President William Ruto accused security agencies of siding with Ford Kenya, the Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula-led party claimed UDA officials were dishing out money at polling stations to influence the outcome of the election.

According to Mr Kimiti, the lawmakers were apprehended after a tip-off by the public who said they were planning chaos. 

 The administrator said that police officers found jembes, batons and other items that could be used as weapons  in one of the vehicles in the convoy. 

But addressing journalists at Bungoma police station, the lawmakers said leaders allied to Dr Ruto are being targeted by police to prevent them from monitoring the vote. 

“A personal assistant of a certain politician was leading the officers arresting us,” said Senator Cherargei, who was the chief agent of the UDA candidate. 

UDA candidate for Kabuchai Evans Kakai said rowdy youths vandalised his pick-up truck at Mukhweya market.

Mr Wetang’ula said lawmakers allied to the Deputy President were criss-crossing the constituency dishing out huge amounts of money. 

“We have reported the matter to security agencies to ensure voter bribery, which is a criminal offence, does not take place in Kabuchai,” the Bungoma senator said told journalists after casting his vote at Namakhele Primary School.
