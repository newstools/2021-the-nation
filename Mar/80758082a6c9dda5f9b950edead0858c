Vaccine sloppiness • Kenya has joined other nations in the Covid-19 vaccination but the health authorities have been a little disappointing, notes Churchill Amatha. “The leadership was expected to reassure all on the safety of the drug.

Intel • Reflecting on his experience, Festus Mwenda says it’s possible to stop the unrest in schools that has seen many facilities razed.

I managed to gather information and quelled any impending unrest.” His contact is fmwenda87@gmail.com.
