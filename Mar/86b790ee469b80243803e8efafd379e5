Twenty-eight local based players have since February been training for the Afcon qualifier matches at Nyayo National Stadium.All the players are expected to report back to camp on Thursday after Mathare United face-off with Kariobangi Sharks in the last league match before the two weeks international break.  Harambee Stars coach Jacob “Ghost” Mulee is confident the team will put up a good show in their upcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, owing to the competitive nature of this season's Football Kenya Federation Premier League (FKF-PL). 

Coach Mulee’s side, who lie third in Group G with three points will on March 25 host leaders Egypt, who are on eight points, before traveling to Lome to face Togo on March 29. Togo are bottom in the pool with just a point.

Speaking Monday during the unveiling of gaming firm – OdiBets, as the team’s official sponsor for the two matches and the three friendlies, Mulee said that unlike before, he now has a big pool to select the best players from.  

“I am happy the league is on now. It is a very tough league, you cannot say who is going to win it,” said Mulee, at the function also attended by FKF president Nick Mwendwa, vice president Doris Petra, Odibets Chief Executive Officer Dedan Mungai among other officials.

});

“The last time when we played our two games against Comoros, we did not have the league. Now it is on and gives us a lot in terms of player selection,” added Mulee. 

Harambee Stars' last friendly match was against Zambia on October 9 and Mulee is confident the three that have been lined up will go a long way in preparing the local based players for the clashes against Egypt and Togo. 

“Our local players have not had any exposure since the start of the league and that is why we organised these friendlies. At least the local players will have a touch and run for the Harambee Stars,” said Mulee, adding that despite their chances of qualifying for the continental showpiece being minimal, they will still give their best.

The company will pump in Sh5 million towards the two matches and three friendlies as well become the team’s motivational partner. 

“With everything going on well, we are committing to supporting the team. Let us be kind to the team regardless of the performance, when things don’t go as expected let us still stand with them,” he said.  

On his part, Mwendwa thanked OdiBets for their continued support and urged Mulee’s charges to put their best foot forward in the upcoming matches.  

“We have a chance to make a statement, not only in this month’s friendly matches and Afcon qualifiers, but also in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers if we give it our all as a team,” he said.  

Twenty-eight local based players have since February been training for the Afcon qualifier matches at Nyayo National Stadium.
