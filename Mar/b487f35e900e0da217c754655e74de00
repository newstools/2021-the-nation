Just before referee Constant Cap blew for half-time, Nakuru was firmly in the driving seat with Felix Okoth scoring a try but Mwaura missed the conversion again. 

Nakuru led 17-7 at half time. 






MMUST came in a rejuvenated side and hardly two minutes into the second half, Timothy Mmasi reduced the arrears with a penalty. 

MMUST missed another penalty in the 73rd minute. Mmasi's kick missed the target. 

Mwaura, who was the man-of-the-match, scored two successive penalties in the last five minutes of the game to seal the fate for the students. 

MMUST coach Ahaya said the team was slowly getting its act together and blamed the defeat on costly mistakes committed by his players. MMUST's Isaya Mulongo was sin-binned. 

"We are taking every step at a time. We contained the experienced Nakuru side from the word go but we committed mistakes that cost us victory. We hope to rectify the mistakes when we tackle Mwamba next," said Ahaya. 

Nakuru coach Felix Oloo said he was satisfied with the result.
