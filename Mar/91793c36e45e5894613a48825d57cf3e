President John Magufuli’s state burial is underway in his childhood village of Chato, in the northwestern part of Tanzania. 

The burial is a culmination of commemorations for the country's fifth president. 

Magufuli’s coffin was transported to six cities to allow people to pay their last respects. 

The Tanzanian leader died aged 61 from what authorities last week Wednesday said was a heart condition, after a mysterious absence of nearly three weeks. Magufuli shattered most of how the person who rules Tanzania as its leader were supposed to conduct themselves. Tanzanian president was flown to Kenya secretly on March 8 after suffering acute cardiac and respiratory illnesses. Mr Kenyatta noted that Kenya has reported a growing Covid-19 positivity rate, and is now higher than when the pandemic started. Murang'a senator says he is recovering at home after a week of hospitalisation. Firefighters are battling a huge blaze that has destroyed thousands of acres of vegetation.
