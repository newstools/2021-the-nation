"The court found that the prosecution had adduced evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offences," said Mr Temba. 

Having been convicted, Mr Shee shall be sentenced in each count as per the law required after a sentence hearing, which is scheduled for April 6, after the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) avails record of the MCA's previous conviction. 

The MCA has been remanded at Hindi GK Prison in Lamu West. Police confiscated metal bars, copper wires, and a gas cylinder which was allegedly used in cutting the metal beams. He also gave out his property to relatives and friends. As the Health ministry disowns Sputnik V deal, the circumstances in which 75,000 does were shipped in and cleared for use stinks of the Kemsa tender scam. The mad rush to beat the curfew deadline has seen many people wait for hours to board a matatu. In the rare instance, an ICU bed becomes available, money will determine if you get it.
