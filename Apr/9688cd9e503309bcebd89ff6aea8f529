The crash involved a Muhsin bus and a Sabaki T shuttle at Kwa Shume near Kizingo, in Kilifi county. 

Malindi sub county medical superintendent Joab Gayo said all the 14 bodies were taken to the facility's mortuary for preservation.

"We admitted 18 casualties in the facility, of whom six were in critical condition," he said adding "those injured were 14 male and four female." 

However, Dr Gayo said some of injured were rushed to private facilities at Tawfique Hospital and Star hospital in Malindi for treatment. 

Kilifi County Commissioner Kutwa Olaka, who visited the accident scene to oversee the rescue operation, said the Muhsin Bus was traveling from Mombasa to Garsen, while the Sabaki T shuttle was heading to Mombasa, from Malindi. The 14-seater matatu was heading to Nairobi from Busia on Sunday afternoon. Last year, 562 people perished in road crashes during the same period. Rampant corruption and lack of accountability in President Kenyatta’s government has seen the country sink into the debt abyss. Health authorities say 279 people have been adversely affected after receiving the vaccine. People are Googling for medicines without knowing if they work, especially for people with comorbidity.
