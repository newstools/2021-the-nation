Muyah, who took over the reign at swimming in September 2016 upon the resignation of Ben Ekumbo, passed away on Tuesday morning at Kenyatta University Hospital. 

KSF deputy president Zack Musembi confirmed that Muyah was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Kenyatta University Hospital on March 29 after falling ill. 

“We are heartbroken to lose such a great leader,” said Musembi. 

Muyah, 54, is survived by his wife and two children. 

Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed was among the first people to send her message of condolences to the late Muyah's family and the swimming fraternity. 

"It is with deep sadness that I have learnt of the passing on of Mr. Patrick Muyah, the Ag. President of the Kenya Swimming Federation. Patrick was an outstanding sports administrator who played a major role in building and strengthening swimming in Kenya," tweeted Amina.
