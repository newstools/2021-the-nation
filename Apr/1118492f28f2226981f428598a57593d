Two decades ago, I had just moved to the USA for my graduate studies and it fascinated me so much that I could print out driving directions from the MapQuest website. Soon after, it was possible to order used textbooks from Amazon.com as opposed to buying new ones from our university bookshop. Shortly thereafter, there was an option to take some of my classes online. Luckily, home internet was available.

Back in Kenya, the concept of cybercafés was growing exponentially in major towns. Locals were starting to use emails as a means of communication and searching online was picking. Cybercafés soon become a trademark for accessing the internet. Since then, so much more has happened. In the last two decades, the digital revolution has spread globally. As such, businesses hoping to survive have had no option but to embrace that revolution. 

At the centre of the digital revolution are a myriad of digital technologies and the connectivity offered through the internet. Even though many of us may not comprehend what has been happening in the back-end of the digital revolution, every day we experience these advancements. 

 The smartphone, digital applications, social media, data analytics, enterprise resource planning systems etc are some of the technological advancements that continue to define the world of business today.
