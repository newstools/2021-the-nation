Mulee said the players did not have experience like the foreign-based players who have been doing duty for the country such as Victor Wanyama. 

There were murmurs from a section of fans because they were not satisfied with the selection largely of players who lacked international exposure. 

In my honest opinion, the team gave a good account of themselves by holding Egypt to a 1-1 draw at home before hitting Togo 2-1 away in Lome despite playing without goalkeeper Ian Otieno, defender Joash Onyango, midfielder Lawrence Juma and striker Michael Olunga, who allegedly tested positive for Covid-19 in Togo. 

The performance of the little-known players in the two matches reminded me of the late German coach Reinhardt Fabish and Marshall Mulwa who could craft a national team in similar fashion. 

Bandari’s speedster Hassan Abdallah stood out in both matches. He scored a goal in each of the games. 

Abdallah stood out 

Back in 2014, under the tutelage of coaches Swale Sunda and Ken Sitati at Green Palms Academy in Mombasa, Abdallah showed promise when he captained the school to their first ever national games in Kakamega after dethroning perennial regional champions Tononoka High School. And he has never looked back. 

Mulee should come to the Coast and scout for talent. We have abundant talent both in the Bandari senior and youth teams as well as in other clubs in the region. 

Like Abdallah who has speed and agility, we have several other excellent players. In an article I wrote in 2019, I said Abdalla deserved to be a regular Stars player, I am happy it has come to pass.

Mulee has tried out Bandari midfielder Danson Chetambe. He should also give a chance to defender Bernard Odhiambo, a younger brother of David Owino “Calabar” and full-back Mohamed Siraj. The law change drive is facing a timeline nightmare even as Parliament goes on a one-month recess. The government’s appetite for debt shot up by 69 per cent between March 2020 and March 2021.
