Bayern Munich were held to a 1-1 home draw by Union Berlin in the Bundesliga on Saturday, three days before their crunch Champions League return leg at Paris Saint Germain. 

Teenager Jamal Musiala beat three defenders to give injury-hit Bayern the lead midway through the first half at the Allianz Arena only for Marcus Ingvartsen to equalise for Union four minutes from time. 

In Paris on Tuesday, European champions Bayern need to overturn a 3-2 first-leg defeat and against Union started reserve team players Tiago Dantas, on a season-long loan from Benfica, and Josip Stanisic.
