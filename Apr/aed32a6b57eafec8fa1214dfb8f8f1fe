The said attacker is reported to have been in violation of the dawn-to-dusk curfew on Saturday night when the incident happened. 

The unnamed officer, a sergeant, was walking to Bypass Patrol Base in Lang’ata at 8pm when he came across the woman. He stopped her to enquire were she was heading to at that time.
