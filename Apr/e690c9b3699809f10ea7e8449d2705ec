The head of State, in his condolence message delivered by Broadcasting and Telecommunications Principal Secretary Esther Koimett, described Kiptanui as a patriotic and loyal Kenyan “whose commitment and devotion to the progress of this country was incomparable”. 

"I have known Kiptanui for many years and I can testify that he was a humble gentleman who believed in hard work and the unity of all Kenyans. It is these qualities that made him noticed and trusted to serve in some of the most sensitive departments of the public service," said President Kenyatta. 

DP Ruto, in a condolence message, delivered by Governor Mandago said the country has lost a transformative and selfless servant leader who served with distinction. 

"He was a modest, courageous, course-driven, hardworking,  responsible,  faithful leader of development and cohesion, who initiated several projects which changed the lives of many," said Dr Ruto.

Honouring exceptional leaders 

Senator Moi asked the people to emulate Kiptanui’s dignified way of life and the humility with which he served the country. 

He asked county bosses from the vote-rich Rift Valley region to find a way to recognise and honour people who served the country with “a lot of dedication”. 

"The life you live until the day you close your eyes  will be manifested in how people will remember you. There are forefathers who served us so well like Kiborgy, Kositany, Athenaeus,  Nicholas Biwott, Kimwatan and our Mzee Abraham ...  let the governor do something about [honouring them]," he said.

Senate Deputy Speaker and Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar eulogised Kiptanui as the true definition of humility in public service. 

“We are here to celebrate the life of a man who was very humble despite being the State Comptroller at a time when power was power. He never allowed power to get into his head. He was always available … he never had two phones...  he maintained humility,” he said. 

Keiyo South MP and Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno said Kiptanui played a key role in elevating the status of schools in the region and sponsored very many students’ education. 

"He did a lot in terms of development and played a key role in education by building several schools," said Mr Rono. 

onyangooluoch85@gmail.com Kiptanui's death brings down the curtains on one of Moi's dependable allies. Almost the entire political class in Nairobi mourned him as a man who embodied pure love, gentle kindness and selfless leadership. The two countries have had trade and health-related spats in the past five years. Health minister Mutahi Kagwe also reported 1,030 new infections and a positivity rate of about 12.4 per cent. Devotha Mdachi's suspension follows revelations of massive misuse of public funds and other resources.
