“But it is our hope [that] Easter mass will be conducted peacefully,” a statement released Thursday said. 

The country is currently observing the 21 days mourning period following the death of President John Magufuli. 

Dr Magufuli died on March 17 at Mzena Hospital in Dar es Salaam and was buried on March 26 at his home town Chato, in Geita region, northwestern Tanzania. 

Following Magufuli's death, Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan announced state mourning for 21 days according to the National Funeral Act. 

The official mourning period began on March 18 and ends on April 7. Easter falls within this period. 

The statement issued by police spokesman David Misime said the police force will be prepared to ensure that the Christian community participates in worship in a peaceful environment as other citizens continue with their activities as usual.
