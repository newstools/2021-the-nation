Charles Twiine, police spokesperson for criminal investigations directorate, told Xinhua by telephone that the Burundian girls were rescued while in transit to other countries for sex trade. 

"We have rescued them (girls) and we have them here. I can't know whether they came from Bujumbura, Ruhengeri or whatever part of Burundi," said Twiine. 

"Uganda is a transit route. We are trying to see how we can work on mechanisms of taking them back," he said. 

The police spokesperson said the suspects will be arraigned to answer to charges of human trafficking. 

"Trafficking of girls is one of the dehumanising crimes that is associated with sexual and labor exploitation," said Twiine.

It is estimated that thousands of Ethiopians are trafficked to foreign countries annually. Health ministry also reports 394 new infections and 14 more deaths.
