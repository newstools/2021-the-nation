Tony Omondi put Kenya ahead with a try but the Chileans staged some lovely buildup to land a converted try and take the lead 7-5 at the break. 

The South Americans were unrelenting as they went for another touchdown, capitalising on Kenya’s sloppy defending to stretch their lead to 14-5.  

Alvin Otieno’s try that Daniel Taabu converted was not enough to rescue the Kenyans. 

Kenya will now meet Spain in the Plate semi-finals. Spain lost to Argentina 24-12 in the quarterfinals. 

In the other quarterfinals results, France hammered Uganda 33-7 while Canada edged out Japan 29-12. 

France were up against Canada while Argentina were to face Chile in the main event semi-finals. 

Kenya finished third in the first leg of the Emirates Invitational Sevens after beating Japan 31-14 in the playoff last weekend. 

The shock defeat came a day after Kenya proved flawless in the preliminaries where they won all their three matches. 

Kenya weathered the storm as they exchanged the leads with Spain before snatching a slim 17-14 victory on Friday. They had earlier beaten Uganda 28-10 and Canada 21-10 in their Pool “Blue” outing.
