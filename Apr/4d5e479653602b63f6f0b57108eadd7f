The former Kenya international will be laid to rest on April 10 in Central Idakho Ward, Ikolomani in Kakamega. 

Andulu leaves behind a widow, Jerida Khakayi, and four children. 

Former international Richard Madegwa, who played alongside Andulu at Nyeri Stima before both crossed over to Leopards in 1989, said: “I express my shock at the demise of Sabby. He was instrumental in our squad…Rest in Peace Sabby.” 

“I mourn one of the greatest defenders who played a big role in putting Leopards back to the top. His skills left fans begging for more,” said former international Martin Musisi. 

Francis Oduor “Killer” remembered Andulu as a key member of the Leopards squad of the early nineties.
