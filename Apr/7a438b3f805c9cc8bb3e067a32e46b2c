But, as it turned out, he was being watched by a number of residents who wanted to win the Sh50,000 bounty police had placed on his head. 

Maina has been on the police radar for more than two years for allegedly establishing a criminal network in Murang’a christened Jeshi ya Gaica. 

He was profiled to have engaged in tens of murders, violent robberies, rapes, and peddling illicit brews and narcotics. On the fateful night, police received crucial information that the wanted man was in his wife’s house and pounced on him. 

He had attracted attention of residents when he sauntered into his house, drunk and singing. 

Dragged out of bed 

Murang’a South Police boss Anthony Keter confirmed the 2am arrest at the suspect’s home in Maica Ma Thi village where they dragged him from under his matrimonial bed. 

“Alcoholism is not a good thing but this is one moment that we as a police unit are unreservedly appreciating it,” he said. “The suspect had sneaked in to check on his wife while drunk and as he approached the gate to his home, he started singing war songs in his drunken stupor. That is how we were tipped that our target was around.” 

Mr Keter said the suspect slid under the bed and attempted to dislodge bricks from the wall to find an escape route. At least five people made calls, tipping the officers about the suspect and the first caller was rewarded with bounty, according to Mr Keter. 

However, he said a consolation reward of Sh2,000 each was made to the other four “just to show them appreciation for their commitment to the rule of law in the principle of community policing.”
