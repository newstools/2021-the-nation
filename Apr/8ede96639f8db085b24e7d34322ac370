The assembly has had a spike in the number of members testing positive for coronavirus disease during the third wave that continues to ravage the country. 

Nairobi County has continued to be the epicenter of Covid-19 contributing to at least 47 percent of positive cases reported countrywide. 

This led to President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 26, 2021, asked parliament as well as county assemblies within the five "disease-infected" counties of Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Nakuru to go on recess until further notice. 

However, Speaker Benson Mutura said they have a full in-tray as they are currently in the middle of budget-making process and grounding the assembly will not be possible. 

The Speaker also said the House has a number of reports from the different committees of the House to be considered by the House Business Committee for debate. 

He, nonetheless, said he will read the communication by the President to the members to make a decision on the way forward. 

Hit hard by Covid-19 

"We are resuming on Tuesday (today) and I will read the communication from the President and then it is upon the members to decide because those powers are with the House," said Mr Mutura. 

"The calendar of the House is constitutional mandate exclusive to the leadership and I or even the President don't have the powers to dictate what to do. However, we are in the budget making process and so we cannot ground completely," he added. 

Mr Mutura said the assembly has been hit hard by the third wave of Covid-19 but was reluctant to reveal names and the numbers "as that will lead to stigmatisation" of the affected members.
