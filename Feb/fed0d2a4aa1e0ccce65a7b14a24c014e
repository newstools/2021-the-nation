Mr Kenyatta outlined his vision for the region, saying he will focus on strengthening partnerships to enhance intra-EAC connectivity and ensure sustainable implementation of projects. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday pledged to ensure a more united and prosperous East African Community (EAC) as he took over chairmanship of the regional bloc. 

The President assured that he will spare no effort in the realisation of the shared aspirations that revived the community 20 years ago. 

“Thank you for showing confidence, faith and trust in me. I promise to do all I can to take our region to greater heights,” he said after taking over from Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame.

New chair’s vision 

Mr Kenyatta outlined his vision for the region, saying he will focus on strengthening partnerships to enhance intra-EAC connectivity and ensure sustainable implementation of projects and programmes in productive sectors. 

“It is desirable that the objectives of the Customs Union, Common Market and Monetary Union, and easier cross-border movement of goods, people and services, is realised,” he said. 

He emphasised the need for partner States to harmonise their commitment on the free movement of people, workers and services as envisaged in the region's common market protocol.
