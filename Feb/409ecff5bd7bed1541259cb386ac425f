The body of former Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae was airlifted to Kisii County on Sunday ahead of his funeral on Monday. 

His children, led by Mike Nyachae, received the body at Kisii School grounds at about 11am, after which it was transported to Nyosia, where Charles Nyachae had been waiting. 

The former Gusii political supremo will be buried in a private ceremony that only his close family members will attend.

Nyachae breathed his last on February 1 at Nairobi Hospital, where he had been admitted for over a month. 

As part of preparations for the burial, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i leading a delegation of top government officials in an inspection tour of Gusii Stadium where a funeral service will take place. 

The CS, who was accompanied by Kisii Governor James Ongwae, Prof Sam Ongeri and Woman Represenative Janet Ongera, said they are anticipating a peaceful ceremony.

Peaceful send-off 

Nyachae’s death appears to have united Gusii politicians, who have come together to give their former kingpin a decent send-off. 

"Nyachae was a peace-loving leader so in his honour, we will ensure a peaceful send-off,” said Dr Matiang’i. 

The CS revealed that President Uhuru Kenyatta directed that the venue of the funeral service be moved to Gusii stadium, from Nyanturago in order to accommodate as many mourners as possible. 

“President Kenyatta ordered that Mzee Nyachae be accorded a state burial. This is because he was a leader of honour who deserves a befitting send-off,” he said during a press briefing at Gusii stadium. 

"Given his status as our leader, we want to accommodate as many people as possible even as we observe guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19," the CS added.

Dr Matiang’i, who headed Nyachae’s funeral committee, added, “We do not want to see a repeat of what happened in Bomachoge last week. Let us honour Mzee Nyachae by avoiding sideshows at his burial.” 

In the Bomachoge incident, a fist fight between politicians marred the burial of Mzee Abel Gongera, father of Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. 

MPs Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango) and Simba Arati (Dagorreti North) engaged in blows as Deputy President Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga watched.

Eulogies 

The leaders who accompanied Dr Matiang’i eulogised the regional political stalwart as a man whose “solid legacy” many generations will benefit from. 

He was roundly described as a man who stood by his word and who espoused discipline and integrity. 

At the Nyosia home, Governor Ongwae, Prof Ongeri and Ms Ongera led other leaders in paying tribute. 

Mr Ongwae also said they expect the service to be peaceful and that they do not want spats between politicians. 

The governor told mourners that Nyachae put the interests of his Gusii community first. 

“He was a selfless leader. He will be remembered by many generations for that,” he said. 

rmbula@ke.nationmedia.com When he died on Monday, February 1, the only position he never got was the presidency. Dr Matiangi met the Gusii lawmakers ahead of Mr Nyachae’s burial in an effort to avert chaos as was witnessed last week in Bomachoge. Traders and youths accused the DP of insulting and demeaning President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kyagulanyi’s legal team is seen as generally lightweight and the petitioner appears short on resources. In what is set to be another blow to the Karume empire, the 128-room, four-star Jacaranda Hotel is set to go under the hammer on March 12.
