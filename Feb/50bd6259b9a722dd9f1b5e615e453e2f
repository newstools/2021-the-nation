No spectators 

The comeback Safari Rally will run from June 24 to 26 in Nairobi and around Naivasha. 

Veteran Safari Rally driver, Frank Tundo will be the Clerk of the Course for the opening round of the 2021 KCB-sponsored KNRC series to be staged on the outskirts of Naivasha. 

“We have done everything possible to make sure the event takes place as intended. The only problem will be that no spectators will be allowed in the stages due to the coronavirus. This will be strictly followed as it is the safety of us all and also following the Government’s laid down rules” said Tundo while talking to Nation Sports.

Incidentally, the RVMSC was the last Club to stage a KNRC almost a year ago before Covid-19 forced cancellations of motor sports events across the nation and beyond. 

The KCB Nyahururu Rally was the last event that was organised properly before coronavirus took over the situation.

Winner of that event then, Baldev Chagger, sounded optimistic when he was asked about his feelings of returning to the competition after a long lay-off. Chagger is a multiple KNRC champion and also a former Safari Rally winner. 

“I have no particular feeling as yet it still seems a little odd that we will finally have an event to compete in. 

“The cars have been ready since April last year so it’s a matter of getting behind the wheel and shaking of the webs both on the machine and me. We shall hopefully test this weekend and I guess that’s when the feeling will set in,” Chager told Nation Sport. 

“We will be in our loyal Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X. The last event was last in March in the KCB Nyahururu that we won before Covid-19, sadly, kicked in. 

“We do look forward to the Motorsport scene opening up again and hopefully see a fair amount of entries in all disciplines under the circumstances. 

“We ask all the fans and supporters of motorsport to keep safe and follow all Covid-19 protocols so we can get to some sort of normalcy in the near future.”

The rest of the Senior officials in the rally will be Ali Alijabri (Event Director), Lynn Tundo (Deputy CofC), Musa Locho (Chief Scrutineer) and Guvi Bhabra as the KMSF Steward. 

The KCB Nakuru Rally stages will be within the outskirts of this year’s WRC Safari Rally sections. 

With the Nakuru Rally scheduled to kick off the season, it will be encouraging for the organisers of the Safari Rally, who are preparing for Kenya’s round of 2021 World Rally Championship in June. 

Phineas Kimathi, the CEO of the WRC Safari Rally, said he was excited with the preparations of the KCB Nakuru Rally, paving away lots of doubts caused by the Covid-19 conditions. 

“The Nakuru Rally will be using part of the Safari Rally stages which gives us lots of hope and encouragement with our World Rally Championship event in June. Nakuru Rally and Safari Rally will be held in the same county which says a lot about our preparations. We wish them luck,’’ said Kimathi.

The Covid-19 factor has played lots of minds creating lots of negativity and tensions while trying to plan for major events in the country.

Soysambu Service Park will host Administration and Documentation on Friday (February 19) followed further with documentation and scrutineering of rally cars. 

The venue will then be the main Service Park for the event on the day of the competition. 

Meanwhile, the new Seeding List will be applied in the Nakuru Rally. 

The Rotation System for the starting order in the 2021 Kenya National Rally Championship season was released last year. 

Each of the top-eight finishers from the previous overall championship of the Kenya National Rally Championship has to start first on road in one of the eight rounds of the series for fair play. 

The rotation system is to make sure that not the same driver “opens” the stages in all rallies. 

Not all drivers, however “courageous or fast” would like to start off first on road as that would mean “clearing” the route for the following cars.

} Rally sport came to a cruel stop because of Covid-19. Races started within Lake Bogoria Spa Hotel. The allocation of the money by Treasury has raised fears of double taxation. KeNHA says only the footbridge at General Motors junction will be affected by construction of the Nairobi Expressway. Nairobi police boss promised that police were doing everything possible to make sure that things were back to normal.
