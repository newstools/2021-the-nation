Police report indicates that the girls planned to contribute money and give it to the worker to  purchase petrol to burn the dormitory.
But one of the learners leaked the information to a teacher who in turn informed officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.
Runjenjes deputy police boss Monica Mwarania confirmed the arrests adding that the girls and the worker are being questioned.
She said the suspects will be charged in court if detectives established that they intended to destroy property.
