Meanwhile, head coach Francis Mwangi is optimistic that their impressive run in NSL will place them in good stead of being promoted to Football Kenya Federation Premier League at the end of the season. 

Police currently top NSL standing with 22 points from 11 rounds of matches, three above Talanta FC who have a game in hand. 

Police FC top scorer is Samuel Githiri with five goals, three less than John Njoroge of Nairobi Stima who leads the scoring chart in the NSL. 

Police FC's only loss this  season came last weekend when they went down by a solitary goal to Silibwet FC at Bomet stadium, a game where their dependable player Reuben Otieno was sent off.  

“We have to work hard and continue fighting to achieve our dream of getting promoted to the top league. These players have proved that they are fighters and our lead at the top of the table is because of a job well done,” said Mwangi whose side have played in the NSL for five years now.
