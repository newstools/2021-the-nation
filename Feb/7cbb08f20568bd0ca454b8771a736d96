Nyachae died on February 1 at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been undergoing treatment.
 He was aged 88.
The veteran politician will be laid to rest at a private ceremony on February 15 at his home in Nyosia, Nyaribari Chache after another funeral service which will be held at the Nyanturago Stadium in Kisii on the same day.
 Born to colonial-era chief Musa Nyandusi, Nyachae was trained in the UK as a public administrator.
 From a district officer in Kagundo, Machakos, he rose through the ranks to be appointed district commissioner at the time of Kenya’s independence in 1963 before serving as a provincial commissioner between 1965 and 1979.





 He later served as a chief secretary and head of civil service during Daniel arap Moi’s era.
 The former minister leaves behind a vast business empire with interests in manufacturing, transport, real estate, banking and large-scale farming. With his death this week, Nyachae has gone to the grave without publicly endorsing Raila's political ambitions. Nyachae and Moi established vast business empires, making them among the richest people in the country. Primary school has been divided into lower (Grades 1,2,3) and upper (Grades 4,5,6).
