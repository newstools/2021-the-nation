Representing his home county of West Pokot, Kibet emerged victorious in senior men's 10km race as his team bagged the top eight positions.
Kibet and Daniel Simiu got off to a brilliant start setting a fast pace in the first lap but the latter, who already had a wild card for national championships, withdrew in the second lap as Kibet opened up a 100m gap to cruise to victory.
With an eye on Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo in March, Kibet said the course was challenging especially in the corners but he had prepared well.

The athlete who is now under the Global Sports Communication training camp in Kaptagat, clocked 30:11.68 beating Linus Kales to second in 30:20.68 with Emmanuel Rutto completing the podium in 30:31.28.
“The course was good despite the corner challenges and my training in Kaptagat has paid off. I had intensified my training to ensure that I get good results to book the national title.
“I will be eyeing a place in the national team that will be heading to the Africa Cross Country Championships where I want to win a medal for my country before I shift my focus to the Olympics Games,” said Kibet.
