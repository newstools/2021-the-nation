On December 6, last year, Jepchirchir closed the year in style, running the fifth fastest time ever in marathon with victory in Valencia in 2:17:16. 

Olunga edged out the likes of boxer Nick Okoth, who won silver at the Africa Olympic qualifier in Senegal to sail through to the Tokyo Olympic Games and Kibiwott Kandie who also won silver at the World Half Marathon Championships in Gdynia, Poland before breaking the half marathon world record in a time of 57:32 on December 6. 

He became the first man to run a half marathon under 58 minutes, breaking compatriot, Geoffrey Kamworor's previous record of 58:01 set in Copenhagen in 2019.
