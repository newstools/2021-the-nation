Literary works 

Mr Kulet’s literary works include Is it Possible,To Become a Man, The Hunter, Maisha ya Hatari, Daughter of Maa, Moran No More, Bandits of Kibi, Blossoms of the Savannah, Vanishing Herds and The Elephant Dance. 

He was born in 1946 in Enkare-Ngusur village, Narok County. 

When the colonial government ordered that all boys be sent to school, his father moved his family to Ilkiremisho, a place that was very far from the nearest school. 

He was eventually enrolled in school where his writing career begun to develop, encouraged by his teachers.

While in high school, most of the boys at his institution, being sons of pastoralists, were encouraged to study range management and animal husbandry with the hope that they would improve their livestock keeping.

Farm management training 

He was one the boys who were attached to large scale white settlers to learn farm management with short stints at Egerton College which, at that time, specialised in training dairy technicians and farm managers. 

He studied farm management at the Egerton College. 

He was then employed as an assistant manager with Kenya Farmers Association in Nakuru. 

It was while working there that he wrote his debut novel, Is it Possible? 

He retired from his career in agriculture at the age of 41 in 1987 as a personnel executive in charge of a work force of over 4,000 employees. 

During his retirement, he wrote nine other books including Blossoms of the Savannah and was awarded the Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature. 

Most of his novels capture aspects of environment, culture and experiences of the Maasai people. 

Daughter of Maa, for instance, is a story of quiet village that is stirred by a frenzy of activities by the arrival of a young and pretty community teacher, Anna Walangh.
