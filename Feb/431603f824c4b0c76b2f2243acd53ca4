“When I left the house there were no stones on the road but on my way back from Rongai town that night, a huge pile had been abandoned. I didn’t notice and hit it. This caused the car to roll,” he said.
Another resident, Felix Waweru, said KeRRA promised them that Ole Kasasi-Rimpa road would be completed within three months but it’s now been a year.
“People have suffered on this road. I have witnessed accidents involving boda bodas and cars. We are now getting news that a new contractor, who is even more ill-equipped, will complete the road,” Mr Waweru said.
School transport
Mr Anthony Mwinzi, a school bus driver, said he spends more than three hours on the road while transporting children.
“Children get to school late because of the poor state of roads here. In addition, if the bus breaks down, the costs of repairs are deducted from my salary,” he said.
