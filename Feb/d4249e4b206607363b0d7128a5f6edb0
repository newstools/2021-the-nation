The Nairobi Expressway was adopted as a remedy for the traffic congestion in and out of the capital’s central business district.KeNHA will partner with Kenya Forest Service in not only beautification of the road but also reinstatement of vegetation cover. The Kenyan economy loses about Sh11 million per hour, or more than Sh100 billion annually, to traffic congestion. The traffic situation in Nairobi alone costs the economy over Sh50 million per day in lost productivity. 

Nairobi is the fourth-most congested city globally. 

The Nairobi Expressway was adopted as a remedy for the traffic congestion in and out of the capital’s central business district. Expected to revolutionise traffic in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area, it is the solution to decongesting the city through provision of a faster and reliable road transport network. The four-lane dual carriageway with 11 interchanges is a convenient and alternative route for motorists.

Reduced travel times 

As construction continues, the government, through the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), will ensure that the project is delivered next year. Works are progressing fast with quality assurance through a testing laboratory.

Relocation of utilities has also begun. Kenya Power has relocated 106 kilometres of power lines between Mlolongo and James Gichuru Road while relocation of water pipes is already complete. 

The JKIA-Westlands expressway will offer value for travel time savings, the benefits businesses and organisations get from reduced travel times. Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (NaMATA) reports show, for instance, the average travel time between Mlolongo and Westlands is two hours instead of just 15 minutes. 

Shorter travel time also means a reduction of exhaust emissions. That not only allows for cleaner air but also clearer sky, protecting the Ozone layer. 

Traffic noise 

Fuel consumption is a key concern. Its reduction will enable motorists to expend the saved amounts in other areas of the economy. The level of traffic noise will also reduce significantly, offering motorists a much-relaxed driving and travel experience. 

The measures taken to reinstate the environment or even improve on what existed is what makes an infrastructure project stand out. Several have been outlined to ensure minimal interruptions to the environment or reinstatement after completion.

Waiyaki Way and the median strip of Mombasa Road have had vegetation cleared to pave the way for road expansion. KeNHA will partner with Kenya Forest Service in not only beautification of the road but also reinstatement of vegetation cover. As policy, more trees are planted to replace those cut. 

Owing to the design specifications, the pedestrian crossings on Mombasa Road have been pulled down to enable road construction works. However, they will be restored upon project completion. 

The expressway will be a breath of fresh air for motorists as it will unlock the full potential of the green city in the sun. The billions lost to traffic congestion will be diverted to other areas of the economy and increase the national GDP, which will push the country closer to fulfilling the sustainable goals towards infrastructure and sustainability.
