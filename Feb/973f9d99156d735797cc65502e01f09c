Waititu had accompanied President Kenyatta during the commissioning of a borehole and the opening of new hospitals in Nairobi's Eastlands area. Former Kiambu Governor, Ferdinand Waititu caused a stir on Friday after he was mobbed by rowdy youths as President Uhuru Kenyatta's convoy left Soweto, in Kayole on its way to Dandora.  

This was shortly after the Head of State had commissioned a borehole and Soweto Hospital and was heading to Dandora to launch Ushirika Hospital.

Just a few kilometres from Soweto, Waititu’s vehicle, which had been allowed space in the convoy, came to a halt in a brief second of hesitation, as the president’s official car appeared to be stopping for the Head of State to address area residents.

Rowdy crowd 

This turned out to be a blunder as residents in the area quickly recognised the politician whom they fondly refer to as “Baba Yao” and thronged his car. 

As soon as Waititu opened his vehicle's door, he was dragged by the excited and rowdy crowd and engulfed in their midst.

The ensuing commotion saw many several vehicles in the president's convoy stopping as police officers rushed to assess the situation. 

By then, Waititu, though being accompanied by one of his security detail, could not control the people who were fixated on drawing the former governor’s attention.

Safety of his car 

Waititu only got back into his car with the help of his security, police officers and a national government administration officer. 

Shortly after the scuffle, President Kenyatta’s car stopped metres away from Waititu’s car, and the Head of State briefly addressed the crowd.

It was then that Waititu, now under tight security, left his car and moved closer to listen to the president.

Gubernatorial race 

The president urged the residents to desist from divisive politics and focus on development and support the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).  

Though denied a chance by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to contest Nairobi’s gubernatorial race two months ago when a by-election in the city was looming, Mr Waititu seems not yet ready to leave the political landscape.

Even when confined to his car, Waititu rolled down his window as the motorcade left for its next destination and would be seen waving furiously to onlookers whose faces lit up when they recognised him.
