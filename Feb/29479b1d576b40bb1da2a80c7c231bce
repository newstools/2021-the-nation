A former bank teller and a trader were on Tuesday charged with stealing over Sh2.8 million from bank accounts belonging to a dead man. 

The suspects, Eutycus Muguna Mutembei and Ayugu Eugene Shivachi, denied 13 counts before Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku. 

State Prosecutor Anderson Gikunda said the two cybercrime suspects used a computer to access the bank accounts of the late Amos Ngatia Muiruri, who died in November 2020.

});

Mr Gikunda said the suspects accessed irregularly Muiruri’s accounts at KCB Bank, Equity Bank and NCBA Bank. 

The alleged offences were committed late last year. 

The two are charged alongside a taxi driver and his wife for preparing to commit a felony. 

Police said the four suspects were arrested in Makuyu, Murang’a and 47 Safaricom sim cards registered under different names were recovered.

});
}, 62000);
}




They denied the offences against them and applied to be freed on bond. 

In the theft case, Mutembei and Shivachi were freed on a cash bail of Sh500,000 each. In the charge of being found with many simcards without a valid reason, the suspects were freed Sh200,000 cash bail each. 

The cases will be mentioned on March 3 for pre-trial directions.
