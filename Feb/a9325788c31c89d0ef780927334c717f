Even under normal circumstances, PLWDs are less likely to access employment, healthcare, education and participate in the community.They are more likely to live in poverty, experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse. That 2020 was a tough year needs no belabouring. It was marked by the measures introduced by governments to curb the spread of the coronavirus that directly effected the economy and livelihoods.
Our national and county governments, industry, businesses and individuals have felt the impact of Covid-19: From loss of revenue to industry closures, job losses and less working hours. As such, 2021 has been billed as the year of transition, now that we know how to live with it.

Challenges
Even under normal circumstances, PLWDs are less likely to access employment, healthcare, education and participate in the community. They are more likely to live in poverty, experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse and are among the most marginalised. The pandemic only exacerbated the regular challenges of most PLWDs, the root of it all being poverty.
Supporting PLWDs in a post-pandemic world needs the concerted effort of the public and private sectors and non-governmental actors. It is crucial that PLWDs participate in economic activities that enable them to earn a livelihood and lead better lives.
The International Labour Organisation says decent and productive jobs, sustainable enterprises and economic transformation play a key role in reducing poverty.Â
