Rogue drivers
Embu West police boss, Mr Charles Kinyua said the crackdown followed accidents caused by rogue drivers.
He said the exercise will continue until all those who have been breaking the laws are apprehended and prosecuted.
"Those who have been arrested will be charged in court with various traffic offences," he said.
Mr Kinyua said the government doesn't want more loss of life in road accidents.

"Accidents have been claiming many lives and we must deal ruthlessly with the offenders," he said.

Mr Kinyua also warned that drivers flouting curfew rules imposed by the government to curb the spread of Covid-19 will not be spared.
"We are checking to find out whether the drivers are wearing face masks or not," he said.
