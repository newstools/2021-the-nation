Some parents have protested the expulsion of six Form Four students at Lugulu Girls in Webuye West over indiscipline.
The students were dismissed last week for allegedly inciting others to participate in an illegal demonstration last year.
Mr Sibalile Natembeya, whose daughter is among those expelled, claimed the students were victimised.

“My daughter protested because a colleague, who is her cousin, had been raped and the matter is yet to be resolved,” said Mr Natembeya.
He appealed to Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha to intervene. The students held demonstrations in December to protest the defilement of their colleague. T
he victim is said to have been defiled while taking a bath before going for the morning preps. She was rescued by a fellow student, with the defiler managing to flee.

The suspect, a teacher at the school, is yet to be arrested.
 School principal Dinah Cheruiyot said the decision to dismiss the students was arrived at following investigations by the board of management. Bungoma residents have accused Principal Dina Cheruiyot of running the school with an iron fist. Protesting learners said the student was attacked on Saturday morning while taking a bath just before the morning preps. Detectives seek to hold former Nairobi county boss for 30 days. He was appointed as the seventh Unctad secretary-general on September 1, 2013. The academic cum political activist is seeking political asylum in Kenya.
