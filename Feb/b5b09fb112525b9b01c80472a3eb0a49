The duel that will get underway at 3pm will be preceded by a women's 10-a-side tournament starting at 12.30pm featuring Mwamba, Impala, Hidden Talent and Twiga RPS. 

Kenya Sevens and 15s lock Dan Sikuta has been named the new captain at Kabras Sugar, taking over from the long-serving eighthman Max Adaka while loose-head prop Elisha Koronya takes the armband from backrow Kevin Angote at Quins.  

Kabras Sugar, the 2016 Kenya Cup champions, have engaged former Zimbabwe international Mzingaye Nyathi, who took over from South African Henley Du Plessis in October last year. 






Quins signed Belgian Antoine Plasman in September last year, replacing Dominique Habimana, who had stayed with Quins for one season. 

"It's quite an exciting moment for me yet challenging since these are uncharted waters for me," said the 28-year-old Sikuta adding that he will still seek guidance from Adaka, who is still at the club to share his experience. 

'Test systems' 

Sikuta, who joined Kabras Sugar for the 2015/2016 season from Mwamba, said that the match comes at an interesting period. 

"We haven't played close to one year because of Covid-19 pandemic. We might have started our preseason in August last year but we have had no build-up matches," explained Sikuta adding that his charges are excited about the new coach saying that he is keen about every player's welfare and game's improvement.

});
}, 62000);

"We just want to test our systems against Quins and compare our notes to see where we are," said Sikuta. 

Kabras Sugar topped the regular 2019/2020 Kenya Cup season, having led the log with 74 points from 15 wins and one loss. 

The season failed to end after the Coronavirus pandemic struck. 

"It's an honor to me to captain this great club that has rich rugby traditions," said Koronya adding that he is delighted to lead a side that currently has rich leadership and experience in players such as Wilson K'Opondo, Patrice Agunda, new signing Joshua Chisanga, Eden Agero and Lyle Asiligwa among others. 

"With this I am able to tap into their wisdom to help me steer this club to previous glory days," said Koronya. 

Talking about their torrid run at the 2019/2020 season where they missed relegation by a whisker, finishing two places above the chopping point, Koronya noted that every season comes with its challenges, and so did last season.  

"We fell pretty hard to a point of fighting a relegation battle but that in itself was more than enough to bring us back to focus," explained Koronya noting that they were generally not properly prepared for the previous season. "The good thing about that is when you hit rock bottom, the only way now is up!"

New signings 

Both Kabras and Quins have beefed up their sides but it's the Ngong Road side that penned some interesting signatures. 

Quins raided Homeboyz to fish out their forwards Joshua Chisanga, Emmanuel Mavala and Phillip Ikambili and kicker Evin Asena. 

Quins have also raided their neighbours, Impala Saracens stable to come out with fly half Xavier Kipng’etich, besides snatching Isaac Wafula and Brian Oyando from Western Bulls and Administration of Police respectively. 

Kabras Sugar have signed six players, two from Mean Machine and a similar number from Western Bulls. 

Winger Alfred Orega is back at Kabras Sugar from Mean Machine where he moves out with forward Aaron Adhanja. 

Teddy Akala and Derrick Ashiundu have traded Western Bulls for Kabras Sugar where Kisumu’s Victor Oduor and Citam Kisumu’s Edwin Ochieng have found a new home. 

Kabras Sugar too have lost two players, Washington Ombima and Teddy Omondi to Kisumu. Nyathi was impressed with Kabras Sugar players’ well-conditioning when he took charge. Initially, the teams had been divided in two pools of six teams each. He encouraged clerics to continue interceding for the nation to defeat the pandemic.
