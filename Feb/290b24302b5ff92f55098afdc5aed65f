The bottom-placed club lost 2-0 to newbies Bidco United Kericho Green stadium on Sunday, a match Iswekha believes they should have performed better.
"My players start the games with a very good pace and create clear cut scoring opportunities, but they always lose concentration towards the end of first half and the last quarter of the game.
They also don't convert the many chances that come their way. This is what is ailing us and I have talked to them about that during our training sessions," Iswekha told Nation Sport on Tuesday.





"I'm optimistic that we shall play well, rectify our mistakes and beat Sofapaka. I have told the young lads that it is possible, so long as they have self belief and follow my instructions on the tactics to be deployed," added Iswekha.
Of the seven encounters, Zoo have only amassed two points from identical 1-1 draws against Bandari on January 9 and Posta Rangers on January 13.
