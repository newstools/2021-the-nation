Speaking during the prize giving ceremony of the ninth leg in the 2020/2021 Safari Tour pro golf series at Karen Country Club, Kenya Vision 2030 Director General Ken Mwige said Kenya is a sporting giant. 






“From Kenya’s first Olympic Gold Medal in 1968, courtesy of Naphtali Temu, running in the 5,000 metres Olympics final in Mexico, Kenyans have blazed, and torched, the running tracks, the roads, and anywhere we are able to compete. Just the other day, our National Basketball Team, the Morans, qualified for the 2021 Afrobasket tournament for the first time in 28 years. The historic win together with other achievements in the sporting arena continue to position Kenya as sports hub with a wealth of talent,’’ he said. 

Mwige said Vision 2030 takes into account the crucial role sports has played in the development of the country. This is outlined in the Social Pillar of Vision 2030 which seeks to harness sports for enhanced social economic and political development. 

“The Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat (VDS) is working hard to cement Kenya’s position as a Global Sports Superpower. Golf is no exception, and will play its part in Kenya’s Middle Term Plan (MTP) on Sports Tourism.  With the support of The Presidency and the Government of Kenya, The Magical Kenya Open is now a European Tour Event, showcasing Kenya as a premier Golf Tourism destination to more than 600 Million people world-wide’’added  Mwige.

The Attorney-General had argued that the court has no authority to address the issues raised by Mr Miguna in the petition. Key allies are pulling in three different directions. Some are telling him to back it, others say oppose it, yet others want him to be neutral. It will cost Kenyan taxpayers an extra Sh3.7bn every year to carter for the proposed seats in Parliament in the BBI Bill, analysts say.
