Sofapaka came off the blocks fast, with midfielder Lawrence Juma and striker Timothy Otieno combining well but their efforts were thwarted by Ulinzi defenders. 

Ulinzi forward Clinton Omondi was a constant menace on their rivals’defence and wasted several chances in the opening half. 

On resumption, Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso made changes that changed the tempo of the game and resulted in Omar Boraafya scoring the opening goal after he tapped in Dennis Waweru’s cross in the 49th minute.

Five minutes later, Oscar Wamalwa converted a penalty after Sofapaka defender Titus Achesa handled the ball in the box. 

Nyangweso hailed his team for putting up a spirited fight in the second that propelled them to their third win of the season. 

“The game was tough but we put more concentration on the second half which really worked for us,” said Nyangweso. 

The coach exuded confidence that they will beat AFC Leopards in the next game even though their current form is good.
