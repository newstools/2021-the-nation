"He was happy. He's my main coach, so it's also an achievement for him. Now he has done it himself and as a coach," he said. 

"So I think he's happy that I've been able to not beat his record yet, but at least do the same as he did. 

"That was kind of the last inch he had on me when it comes to Norwegian records in tennis," he added. 

Ruud senior, who reached a career-high ranking of 39, to his son's current 28, crashed in the last 16 in 1997 to Goran Ivanisevic, who is also in Melbourne as coach of world number one Novak Djokovic.

DP says he will continue respecting the decisions of the President because he is "the one in charge and who calls the shots". The country has introduced a 1,000-pound note to ease transactions but experts say it will not help the economy much.
