Kimathi’s father Julius Marete said his son’s attacker escaped after the incident.
“We got a call at around 8pm informing us that our son had been stabbed.
“A Good Samaritan took him to hospital where died while receiving treatment,” said Mr Marete.
While confirming the Saturday night incident, Engineer Sub-County Police Commandant Naomi Moraa said that the assailant was still at large and the police have launched a manhunt for the suspect.
"A team of our officers has been dispatched to hunt down the assailant. We are also working with our colleagues in other counties where we suspect that he is hiding and in time I am sure that we will get them," said the police boss.
