Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce a month-long extension of a virus state of emergency later Tuesday -- meaning the measure will run until March 7 in Tokyo and several other parts of the country.

Tighter border restrictions imposed after infections surged have already forced the postponement of some sporting fixtures including this year's first Olympic test event, an artistic swimming qualifier that was scheduled for March.
The nationwide Olympic torch relay is still due to begin on March 25.
On Wednesday, organisers are expected to outline further details of the extensive coronavirus countermeasures they have devised for the 2020 Games, which were pushed back to 2021 last March as the virus spread around the globe.
