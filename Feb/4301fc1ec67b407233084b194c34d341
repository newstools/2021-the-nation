DCI defeated Nairobi Prisons 3-0 (25-21, 25-16, 25-23). 

DCI coach Daniel Bor said they worked for the win after losing their opening match against KCB during the first leg that was played last month in Nairobi. 

Bor remained hopeful ahead of Sunday's clash against Nairobi Water who are winless this season. 

"We hope to build on the new found form in the forthcoming clashes. We made a debut in the play-offs in 2019, and I hope we will guard our slot when the regular season comes to an end. I know the competition is tough but we are committed to go all the way," said Bor. 

Nairobi Prisons coach Sally Wanzala said they are still adapting to the league. 

"We are new in the league and stil learning the ropes. With hard work and determination, I guess the win will come through," said the former national women's  team setter. 

In other results, KFS  recovered from their earlier loss against GSU to beat newcomers Rift Valley Prisons 3-0 (25-15, 25-21, 25-18), as Administration Police came from behind to see off Nairobi Prisons 3-2 (20-25, 25-15, 20-25, 27-25 and 17-15).
