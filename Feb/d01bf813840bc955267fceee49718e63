Abel Kipsang from Ngong settled third in 1:46.36 with 2011 Africa Junior 800m silver medallist Jeremiah Mutai coming fourth in 1:47.27 in third heat.
“It felt good to win with such a good time and I had to appreciate my fans after I had seen their reaction,” said Rotich, who declared war against the reigning World 800m champion Donavan Brazier from United States ahead of Tokyo Olympic Games.





Rotich disclosed that training has picked up well having opted to start preparations early this time around unlike previous seasons.
“I started preparations in December unlike before when I delayed to January since I am not an Indoor championships athlete,” said Rotich, who besides targeting Olympics glory after finishing fifth at 2016 Rio Summer Games, wants to lower his personal best to sub 1:42.
Rotich boasts personal best 1:42.54 from the 2019 Monaco Diamond League. “I feel in better shape than before and I want to see how it goes this year. I want to run 1:41 perhaps in Monaco this year,” said Rotich, 31, who is eager to compete in 2x2x 400m at the World Relays.
'Sweet wine'
