The Kenya contingent here are not happy with the way the Cameroon health officials are doing the Covid 19 tests, saying its like punishment being meted on them.

"These guys are not testing Covid-19, but hurting us. I have been tested several times since the coronavirus pandemic struck, but I have never gone through this nonesense," Kenya head coach Elizabeth Mills said after the test on Wednesday. 

Her sentiments were echoed by Margaret Ngati Nyambura and Dr Walter Juma Ongeti, the Kenyan government representatives, who think the Cameroonian health officials are overdoing the testing. 






"We went through the same at the airport on arrival on Monday and are now being taken through the same here at the hotel  This is unacceptable because some of us might leave this place with injured noses," Ongeti said. 

Kenya Morans player Ronnie Gundo has called on the health officials to be gentle when they do the final test on Sunday morning.  

"They hurt my nose and I don't think if this is the way to do the testing. The either don't know what they are doing, or they are exaggerating everything," an angry Gundo said.
