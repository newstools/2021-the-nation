The Sh379.03 million award is, however, a reduction from the Sh504.8 million (at the current exchange rate) earlier granted to Mr Ndung’u in 2018 by the arbitrator, John Ohaga, which had prompted KPMG to seek redress in the High Court. 

“I find and hold that the claimant has suffered loss and damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents towards him since the commencement of investigations against him from October 3, 2016 culminating in his purported compulsory retirement on January 13,2017 and the announcement," the judge said.
