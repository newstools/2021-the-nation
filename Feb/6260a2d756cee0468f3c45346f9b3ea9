“It is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to AFC Leopards, a club that has given me so much as a player and most recently as a coach. It has been an honor and privileged to serve this great club. Today, I leave here knowing more than when I arrived and it is all because of you,” said Kimani. 
“I would like to thank the club, led by the Chairman Dr. Dan Shikanda, SG Oliver Shikuku, Treasurer Maurice Chichi and CEO Victor Bwibo. You gave me an opportunity to serve this great club and I will forever be grateful. To the players, led by captain Robinson Kamura, I would like to thank you for the respect, belief and trust that you have shown me throughout my time at the club.”
