Oroo succumbed to a stroke at Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu County last week. 

The lawmaker, who was born in Suneka  in 1950, has left behind six children. His second wife is called Pamela Atieno. 

A chopper carrying the MP’s body arrived at Suneka Airstrip at around 9.30 am. 

The body was then transported to Itierio Boys’ High School grounds for a funeral service ahead of the burial at his Suneka home.

The former Nairobi Governor did not appear in court as expected as he is sick. Mr Rusesabagina had questioned the court’s jurisdiction in hearing his case. He wisely booked a Kenya Airways flight and not an Ethiopian Airways one, as he believed the latter could be grounded any time by the government.
