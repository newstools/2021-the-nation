Vaccines bring hope
He added that thought the number of infections has grown tremendously, the arrival of vaccines has given hope to humanity.
“I wish to make it abundantly clear that nobody is safe around the world until everyone is vaccinated,” Mustapha said.
The Director-General of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, also reported that there has been increasing transmission of the virus.
“We are working very hard to get access to the vaccines because if we don’t, the virus keeps circulating, mutating and potentially getting better adapted to the environment and its ability to transmit.
“We are gradually experiencing an increase in the number of deaths. These are tragic circumstances. Everything we are doing in the response is really about preventing severe cases and death. This is what we are most worried about,” Dr Ihekweazu said.
