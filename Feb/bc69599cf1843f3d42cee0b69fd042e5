“Applicants must take note that it is a criminal offence to provide false information and documents in the job application and the same will be verified by relevant bodies,” a gazette notice by acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on January 18 warned.
The next CJ will be the third after the promulgation of the constitution and will be earning a salary of between Sh900,000 and Sh1,327,888. The Salaries and remuneration Commission (SRC) capped the salary of the Chief Justice in 2017 at Sh1.3 million with an entry package of Sh990,000 minus allowances.
To ensure transparency, the JSC Act requires the commission to constitute a selection panel consisting of at least five members.
Their function is be to shortlist persons for nomination by the commission. The JSC will also be filling one position of a Supreme Court judge, which has remained vacant since Justice Ojwang' retired in February last year.
