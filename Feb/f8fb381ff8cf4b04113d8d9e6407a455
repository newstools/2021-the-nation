His psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov and heart surgeon Leopoldo Luque are already under investigation, as they were treating Maradona before his death.
The three people newly under investigation must appear before prosecutors this week, the judicial source told local media. 
Investigators are trying to determine if any of the five people who had Maradona in their care were in any way negligent.
Maradona was suffering from liver, kidney and cardiovascular disorders, but there were no signs of alcohol or narcotics consumption, according to his autopsy.
