Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) chairman Peter Kanyago gave the hint during the prize-giving ceremony of the Safari Tour eighth leg at Muthaiga Golf Club on Wednesday. “We are currently holding talks with the European Tour and it is my belief that a second European Tour in Kenya is possible this year,’’ said Kanyago who at the same time said arrangements for this year’s Magical Kenya Open have been completed and that just like it was announced earlier, this year’s Open will be a closed event.

“It is unfortunate that this year we will not have spectators, though we have a VIP tent while Karen members can watch the event from the balcony of the club house,’’ said Kanyago who said the 15 professionals who will participate in the Open will be known after the ninth and final leg of the Safari Tour at Karen Country Club which will begin with the Pro-Am next Saturday.
Out of the 15 players, three will be those from the other African countries such as Uganda, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Rwanda.  
Currently the top 12 Kenyans are Greg Snow, Dismas Indiza, Simon Ngige, David Wakhu, Eric Ooko, Samuel Njoroge, John Wangai, Justus Madoya, Edwin Mudanyi, Mathew Omondi, Jacob Okello and the winner of the eighth leg at Muthaiga Golf Club Mohit Mediratta.

It is however the top six who are assured of a place in the Open while the rest will have to fight it out for points at the Karen event next week. Leading the foreign players is Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi, who is followed in second place by Deo Akope of Uganda, Philip Kasozi also from Uganda, Nigeria’s Andrew Odoh, Alloys Nsabimana of Rwanda, and Zambia’s Dayne Moore.
At the same time Kanyago said the 2021/22 Safari Tour series will start in May with an increased number of events. This year the Tour had only nine tournaments including the Uganda Open, but there will be 12 events in 2021/22. He however said more details will be announced soon.
