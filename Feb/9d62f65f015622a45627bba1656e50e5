The Nation FC bench, featuring tacticians John Wahome, John Ashihundu and Allan Munga, along with team manager Elias Makori, then made tactical substitutions in the second half, bringing in Titus "Tito" Mbithi, Anthony Omondi and Washington Vihembo for Bennis Otieno "Obi", James "La Liga" Tiku and Collins Omondi, introducing extra pace and cushioning the defense.

The change of pace paid off in the 85th minute when Augustine Kuta scored the winner after left back Kevin Lwangu overlapped and passed the ball to Mbithi whose defence splitting pass was met by Kuta who made no mistake from close range. 

"It is was a tough match considering that we just started training a week ago at St Mary's School, but the team displayed great maturity," Makori said. 

"We'd like to thank our CEO Stephen Gitagama and our supporters St Mary's School and StarTimes who have supported our training and travel to Vihiga in various ways."
