Army coach William Wahome confirmed that the team will not be part of the league this season, but was quick to note that they will be back next season which is scheduled to start in October. 

Wahome, who also coaches the men's team that features in the league, said during the January trials, that were conducted at their backyard at Kahawa Garrison in Nairobi, they were not able to recruit a strong squad that would challenge for the title. 

"We wrote to KVF two weeks ago notifying them we will not to compete in the league. I know our communication came in late since they had already drafted the fixtures but it was only fair to pass the message," said Wahome.

"We intend to recruit heavily going forward and hopefully we will be ready for next season. Our focus now switches to the men's team and although we begun the league poorly, we hope to regroup and do better as the league gathers momentum." 

Kenya Army was scheduled to play former champions Kenya Pipeline this Saturday before taking on Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) on Sunday at the indoor Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi. 

With Army's withdrawal,  the women's league remains with seven teams that features champions Kenya Prisons,  KCB Women's Volleyball Team, Pipeline, Directorate of Criminal Investigation, KDF,  league returnees Nairobi Water and new comers Nairobi Prisons.
