Mandera Governor Ali Roba has been bold in raising the red flag over the threat to key sectors like education.The Al-Shabaab resurgence provides room for novel counter-terrorism strategies and emergence of anti-terror champions In the recent past, there have been concerns that the Al-Shabaab menace is creeping back into the northeastern region, threatening law and order. Mandera County, which borders war torn Somalia, where the terrorists are domiciled, is most affected with increased attacks targeting both civilians and security personnel as well as destruction of infrastructure such as communication masts.

Mandera Governor Ali Roba has been bold and magnanimous in raising the red flag over the threat to key sectors like education. 

But every cloud has a silver lining. The Al-Shabaab resurgence provides room for novel counter-terrorism strategies and emergence of anti-terror champions. And Governor Roba fits the bill to spearhead that war. 

That he has admitted to there being a security problem gives him leeway to work towards addressing it. His call to residents to rise up against Al-Shabaab resonated well with not only local communities but the entire country.

Anti-terrorism war 

It is high time other leaders from Mandera, Garissa and Wajir followed in his footsteps. 

Kenyans need to heed such noble calls and be in the forefront in the anti-terrorism war for development to thrive. The ‘people power’ approach can prove to be mightier than government-based military approach. Soft power galvanises the population to roll out community initiatives, which have better results compared to State hard power. 

One such initiative is establishing a tamper-proof community reporting of suspicious activities, exposing Al-Shabaab’s modus operandi and identifying its sympathisers. Security personnel can use such actionable intelligence information to neutralise the threat. Residents can also volunteer to the National Police Reserve to help in the crackdown as they are more familiar with the terrain and other dynamics.

It is the civic duty of local communities to protect the country from external aggression and enable the region to prosper. Patriots must not succumb to threats to force submit to their criminal ideals. Let them reject in toto the tired and anachronistic rhetoric from Al-Shabaab, such as misplaced promises to ‘liberate’ Muslim lands and irredentist slogans that have no place in modern Kenya. 

The region is reaping the fruits of devolution. Colossal amounts of devolved, equalisation and other funds from the national government have revolutionised the region for the better. 

Quality services 

There is notable improvement in key sectors like health, infrastructure, water and education, to the extent that Somali nationals cross the border to enjoy the quality services offered in the counties. This is incomparable to Somalia, which is ravaged by terrorism and civil war. 

Our collective actions to counter terrorism will make Kenya a safe investment destination. The fight against terrorism is not a preserve of governments. 

The citizens, too, can actively participate in this worthy cause in many ways. Let everyone stand and be counted as a dependable ally in the anti-terror war.
