Kenya Morans Friday put up a spirited display against basketball powerhouse Senegal before losing 69-51 in their opening Group “B” match of the second and final round of the Afrobasket qualifiers at the Palais Des Sports Complex here in Yaounde on Friday. 

Kenya, coached by Australian Elizabeth Mills, were a much improved side from the last time the two sides met in the first round of the qualifiers in Kigali last November were they lost 92-54.

After a slow start which saw the West Africans take the first quarter 21-18, the Kenyans hit back 13-6 in the second quarter to lead 31-27 at the break. 

The Senegalese would then take command of the match in the third period, outscoring Kenya 25-10 for a 52-41 lead heading into the last quarter. 

Playing with only 10 players after point guard Joseph Khaemba and forward Joel Awich remained in isolation after a Covid-19 scare, Kenya coach Mills had a lot of adjustment to do in her starting five playing with a makeshift playmaker.

Griffin Ligare, the other point guard who could have started in place of Khaemba, arrived here on Thursday afternoon and was cleared to play a few minutes as the game tipped off shortly after his Covid-19 test results were out.  

Khaemba who was enjoying good form had tested positive for Covid-19 when the results for the first test done on Wednesday were released forcing him to undergo another test with the entire Kenya squad on Thursday.  

Awich also had to be isolated despite testing negative because he was Khaemba's roommate. 

Both however tested negative on Friday and could be available for Saturday's game against Angola. 

Morans started well outscoring Senegal 7-0 inside the first two minutes with Desmond Owili opening the scoring with a three pointer before going for a two inside the paint moments later. Okari made it 7-0 with another easy two point shot.

Then came in Senegalese dangermen Chiekh Bamba Diallo who had a good day in office with four  treys within three minutes helping his team lead 21-16 from his 12 points despite Bush Wamukota and Preston Bungei contributing vital points for Morans in this tight first quarter. 

The second quarter however belonged to Morans who outscored Senegal 13-06  for a comfortable 31-27 half-time score. 

The impressive Bungei brought his A game as Ronnie Gundo, Valentine Nyakinda and Tylor Okari clicked with easy points from well executed plays in the Senegalese half but still allowed Diallo to make his threes to reduce the margin which could have been bigger at the break had Okari made the two free throws awarded to him on the buzzer. 

Senegal took their first lead six minutes into the third quarter at 37-35 as Diallo ran riot making threes  at will. 

Bungei and Gundo replied with two points as Senegal took the third quarter 52-41 after the huge Youssoupe Ndoye, Papa Malik Dime, Papa Abdou Badji and Faye Ibrahim built a temporary 'Berlin Wall' inside their defence blocking all shots from Morans and hitting Kenya on transition for a 69-51 scoreline.

"We lost concentration towards the end of the game allowing our opponents very easy points, something we want to rectify before our fixture with Angola," Morans coach Mills said while praising her charges for a gallant fight.
