The lender said the branches targeted for closure are those close to others, which will be merged with the primary ones in their respective areas. Diamond Trust Bank Kenya (DTB) is set to close six of its branches as it seeks to reduce its rising operational costs.

The branches will officially be closed on June 30. 

Central Bank approved 

The branch at the Garden City Mall, where the loss of anchor tenant Shoprite led to reduced foot-traffic, will be taken over by the Thika Road Mall branch from September 30. 

The Eastleigh branch will be merged with the Medina Mall branch from October 30. 






“The Central Bank of Kenya has approved an application by Diamond Trust Bank to consolidate its branches in certain locations within the country. The branch consolidation will affect locations where the branches identified for merger are co-located or in close proximity to each other,” DTB said. 

“The staff in the affected branches will be redeployed appropriately to support other branches or business units within our network,” the bank said. 

Rising costs 

This comes after a fall in the lender's shareholders’ return on equity from 13 per cent in 2018 to 12 per cent in 2019. 

Non-performing loans increased from Sh12.1 billion to Sh13.6 billion in the same period while the cost to income ratio rose from 43.9 per cent in 2018 to 46.5 per cent in 2019, highlighting a rise in operating costs. 

DTB, which is banking on technology to reduce expenses, issued a profit warning last December as its earnings after tax to September fell 28 per cent to Sh4 billion.
