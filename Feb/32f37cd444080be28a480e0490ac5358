However, the Confederation of Africa Athletics (CAA) on Wednesday postponed the sixth edition of the Africa Cross Country Championships that was due for March 6 to 7 in Lome, Togo. 

CAA made the announcement following a request by the Togolese authorities who raised safety measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, the event was cancelled altogether as the world grappled to contain the spread of coronavirus.

The President and Mr Odinga are expected to launch the nationwide Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) campaigns on Monday. The DP has poked holes in the BBI but has refused to oppose it outright even under pressure from some of his allies.
