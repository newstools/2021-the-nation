“This is the first case of this nature to be reported in this area," Mr Wanjuu said. 

The police boss said the learners confessed that they had been smoking bhang even in school. 

“They told us they have been smoking bhang during lunch and break time," Mr Wanjuu said, adding that the pupils may be charged in court after consultations with children’s officers.

He also said that police are pursuing drug dealers who have been selling drugs to the school children in the area. 

“We have learnt the learners are buying bhang from notorious drug peddlers and we are pursuing them," he said. 

He warned that police will not sit and watch as the peddlers continue ruining the lives of the young ones. 

Further, Mr Wanjuu advised parents to continue monitoring and counselling their children to discourage them from using drugs. 

“It is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that their children don't abuse drugs which are being sold by unscrupulous traders in the area," he said. Police believe that those already arrested had been hired to maintain and take care of the farm.
