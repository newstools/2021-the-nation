Belgian native Aussems praised his charges for pressing for the much needed win, saying substitutions he made led to the late goal. 

"It feels good to win and we shall build on this in the coming matches. It was a tough game, but we fought and pushed through to get this win. This is a good result and we focus on our next game," said the 56-year-old Aussems, who was taking charge of his second league match.

His opposite number, Benjamin Nyangweso, blamed his defenders for the loss. 

"It was a defensive lapse which cost us the game and our strikers were also not efficient in finishing. We still have a lot of work to do especially in our attack, but it is good they keep improving in each game," said Nyangweso. 

In Wundanyi, KCB missed the chance to close the gap on Tusker after settling for a 2-2 draw with Sofapaka.  

Batoto ba Mungu were heading for a win thanks to Lawrence Juma's brace, before Regan Otieno scored a 77th minute equaliser for the Bankers, who remain second with 26 points, six behind Tusker.

First to threaten 

Leopards were the first to threaten in the seventh minute, Burundian Fabrice Mugheni picking out Ingwe's top scorer Elvis Rupia, whose effort went wide. 

In the 16th minute, Ulinzi Stars defender Brian Odiaga received the first booking of the game after a foul on winger Harrison Mwendwa at the edge of the box. 

A minute later, Ulinzi Stars attacker Oscar Wamalwa danced past Ingwe defenders, but failed to unleash a powerful shot with a clear chance at goal as Ugandan custodian Benjamin Ochan easily raced and grabbed the ball. 

Leopards dictated proceedings and Mwendwa would again pick out Rupia on the left at the half hour mark, but Ulinzi keeper James Saruni punched it out of the field of play with the fourth official flagging the danger man for offside. 

Ingwe's best chance came five minutes to the breather when Mwendwa's ferocious shot hit the goal post after lashing on a loose ball after Harun Mwale's failure to clear a dangerous ball. 

John Kago was booked after committing a foul on Said Tsuma in the dying minutes of the first half.

In a surprise turn of events, Ulinzi Stars players opted not to use the dressing room and sat at the edge of the pitch during the half time break. 

At the restart, both Aussems and coach Benjamin Nyangweso made changes to improve their team's fortunes.

Nyangweso brought in Omar Boraafya and Ibrahim Shambi for Clinton Omondi and Elvis Nandwa, while Marvin Nabwire and Caleb Olilo replaced Tsuma and Mwendwa for Leopards. 

Burundian Bienvenue Shaka wasted a glorious chance to give Leopards the lead in the 67th minute when he side netted after dribbling past Saruni. 

The goal finally came as second half substitute Peter Thiong'o, who had earlier come on for Jaffery Awiti , easily slotted home from Austin Odhiambo's low cross.
