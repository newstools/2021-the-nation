Gor seemed to be heading for victory before Emmanuel Mayuka's 94th penalty gave the hosts the advantage and they held on to clinch a place in the group stages. Gor Mahia on Sunday missed the chance to qualify for the Caf Confederation Cup group stages after a 2-2 draw away to Zambia's Napsa Stars saw them knocked out 3-2 on aggregate. 

Gor seemed to be heading for victory before Emmanuel Mayuka's 94th penalty gave the hosts the advantage in the second leg play-off and they held on to clinch a place in the group stages.

Mayuka was returning to the team after missing the first leg where Gor had lost 1-0 at the Nyayo National Stadium a week ago. 

Samuel Onyango put Gor Mahia ahead in the 17th minute, but midfielder Austin Banda replied a minute later to put the Zambians back into the game. 

Winger Cliftone Miheso then produced a significant finish to put Gor a head in the tough fixture attended by 200 fans due to the strict covid-19 measures put in place by the  Zambian government.

Caf had initially allowed Napsa Stars to have 4,500 fans to cheer the home side. 

Travelling challenges marred K’Ogalo’s journey and they arrived in Zambia less than two hours to the game. 

Gor left Nairobi almost at noon after finally raising funds to make the trip and arrived in Zambia minutes past 2pm making their way straight to the Heroes National Stadium where their opponents had already started training in anticipation of the tie. 

Gor have now failed to repeat the same feat they achieved in 2019 when they qualified for the group stage of the same competiton after beating New Star of Cameroon 2-1 on aggregate. 

K’Ogalo finished as runners up behind Egyptian giants Zamalek in a group which consisted of Angola's Petro de Atletico and Na Hussein Dey of Algeria.

K’Ogalo were later eliminated by RS Berkane 7-1 on aggregate in the quarter final stage. The trend of Gor Mahia travelling on match day or on the eve of the game is not new. KCB are now four points behind leaders Tusker. Most experts on the Horn of Africa say Turkey’s near-neutral engagement with the region may be influential. The cause of the accident is still unknown but officials said the pilot had reported an engine failure. They have abandoned UDA's Urbanus Muthama Ngengele and thrown their weight behind Wiper's Agnes Kavindu Muthama.
