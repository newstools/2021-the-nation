Tension remains high in Kabuchai following a series of violent incidents between rival political groups ahead of next Thursday’s by-election. 

Supporters of Ford-Kenya candidate Majimbo Kalasinga were on Tuesday attacked as candidates intensified campaigns to woo voters in readiness for the March 4 mini-poll.

One of the supporters, only identified as Junior, said he was attacked by a rival group, escaping death by a whisker. 

"It all began when I arrived home to find another aspirant holding a meeting on part of our family land," he said. 

He said that at that point he demanded to know why an opponent of his preferred candidate chose his home as a meeting point. 

This prompted supporters of Mr Gasper Wafubwa, an independent candidate, to attack him, causing him bodily harm. 

He was taken to hospital by area politician Simiyu Mutaki.

Mr Kalasinga, who condemned the incident, said he was attacked by about 50 men armed with crude weapons at a restaurant at Mayanja. 

He said the attackers threatened to kill him, prompting the bar owner to call  police. 

The violence continued into the night as they engaged in a cat and mouse chase from Mayanja to Chwele. 

The attackers also beat up Kalasinga’s men inside the police station in front of the seemingly care-free policemen as Kalasinga’s team sought refuge in the station. 

Mr Kalasinga said he and his supporters were again attacked at the station and beaten under the watch of policemen. 

Both Mr Wafubwa and Junior separately reported the incident at Chwele Police Station with Mr Wafubwa handing over the weapon Junior had to officers.

Popular local musician Kasembeli Watila, who was accused of beating Junior, distanced himself from the claim, saying he indeed shielded him. 

He said that three vehicles on Wednesday visited his home and the visitors promised to torch his house at night. 

Diana Nekesa, who was present at the meeting, told journalists that  Wafubwa had a right to hold a meeting there. 

UDA’s Evans Kakai and Majimbo Kalasinga have asked police to investigate the matter and bring the culprits to book. 

"On Tuesday, a youth who supports Ford Kenya candidate Majimbo Kalasinga was attacked at his home and injured. 

''Junior'',  as he is popularly known in Kabuchai constituency, is a staunch supporter of Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula," he said. 

He suffered serious head injuries and was rushed to a local dispensary where first-aid was administered. 

Mr Kakai said he has never planned nor thought of attacking his fellow candidates. 

“We have learned, regrettably, through social media, that one aspirant in the Kabuchai by-election was purportedly attacked by youths at a bar in Mayanja,” read the statement. 

The Kabuchai and Matungu by-elections are slated for March 4. He says Mr Majimbo is best suited to replace the late MP James Mukwei. Tangatanga-allied politicians have come under fire over their remarks against Senator Moses Wetang’ula. The cost of running the SGR was the highest in 2019, hitting Sh18bn against the Sh13.5bn in revenues generated for the year. The President and Mr Odinga are expected to launch the nationwide Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) campaigns on Monday. The DP has poked holes in the BBI but has refused to oppose it outright even under pressure from some of his allies.
