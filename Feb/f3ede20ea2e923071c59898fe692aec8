“It is a pity that death has robbed us of a determined and a progressive grassroots leader, who used his long experience as a teacher and administrator to develop his constituents through education,” he said. 

“Oroo’s love for education was demonstrated in his setting up of a private teachers’ college to serve his community after his retirement from public service. That was a selfless leader who knew and appreciated the transformative value of empowering the youth through education.”
