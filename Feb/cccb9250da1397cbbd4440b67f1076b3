She clinched her maiden National Cross Country title before going on to win the World Cross Country Championships crown in Kampala after finishing 13th in 2013 Bydgoszcz and 20015 Guiyang. 

Cheptai then took a maternity break before coming back in 2019 combining road and track racing. But a hip injury prevented her from hitting her previous heights.

However, Cheptai, who finished second in the North Rift Region Cross Country Championships last weekend behind Vicotty Chepng’eno, is determined to regain the good form she had in 2017. 

She is among top athletes, who will be battling for top honours at the Lotto National Cross Country Championships at the Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi on Saturday.

The championships once again received a major boost yesterday when gaming firm Lotto Foundation unveiled Sh7 million sponsorship for this year’s event. 

This is the sixth year Lotto are getting involved in the competition that will be used to select the national team for the Africa Cross Country Championships due on March 6 in Lome, Togo. 

The continental event was moved from last year due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Cheptai, who is training in Iten under coach Barnaba Chirchir, will face three other athletes, who have won the national senior women’s title once before. 

They are  defending champion Sheila Chelangat (Police), the 2016 titleholder Alice Aprot (Prisons) and 2018 winner Stacy Ndiwa (Police). 

“My intentions are not to win per say but continue testing my body as I recover from the nagging hip injury,” said Cheptai whose main focus is to  make a maiden appearance at the Olympic Games by earning a ticket in Kenya’s 10,000m team.
