Mr Hamad died at the age of 77.

Tanzanian President John Magufuli sent his condolences to Mr Hamad’s family and residents of Zanzibar.

Dr. Mwinyi, Family, Zanzibaris, ACT-Wazalendo members and all Tanzanians. May his soul rest in peace, Amen,” President Magufuli wrote on his Twitter handle. 






On February 1, he was admitted at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital and he confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19.
