The nine-hole Nyeri Golf Club course in Nyeri County is where the action will be this weekend.

This year’s event had attracted over 140 players though the organisers had to reduce the field to those playing off handicap 13 or better.
It will be the first national event to be played under the newly introduced World Handicap System (WHS), which starts officially on Friday.
Leading the elite golfers in search of the Mt Kenya Championship trophy, will be Kiambu Golf Club’s Michael Karanga, who beat a star field at Sigona Golf Club a week ago to claim the season opener in the series, the Sigona Bowl tournament.

However, a number of top ranked amateur players in the country will miss this weekend’s action in Nyeri.
They include Kenya Amateur Stroke play champion Jay Sandhu of Royal, Match Play champion Issac Makokha, Nyali’s Adel Balala, Mutahi Kibugu, and Njoroge Kibugu.
Both Sandhu and Makokha are preparing for the 2021 Magical Kenya Open, while Balala and the Kibugu brothers, Mutahi and Njoroge, are away in South Africa for a number of national events including the South Africa Stroke Play championship.
