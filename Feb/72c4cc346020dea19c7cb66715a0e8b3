County police commander Samson Ogelo said that no charges will be preferred against those who surrender the illegal arms within the amnesty period.

“I urge Samburu locals, especially those in conflict zones where we believe there are illegal guns to surrender them. We know the dangers of guns in the wrong hand. The government is the sole authority in providing security," Mr Ogelo said.
Mr Ogelo said Samburu has made great progress in security, which he attributed to the good working relationship among leaders, citizens and government agencies.
He revealed that 17 illegal firearms have been surrendered between the months of November and January this year, noting that residents have been repentant and cooperated with security agencies.

The police boss praised residents for surrendering the arms, saying they were being used to kill and steal livestock, fuelling conflict among communities. Mr Ogelo said it was against the law for residents to continue possessing firearms without government permission.
According to Mr Ogelo, they will continue to engage locals in meetings together with other local administrators to educate them on the need to surrender the firearms.
"We will engage locals leadership and local administration to sensitise them on the need to surrender the weapons in this period," he said.
Mr Ogelo assured residents that police will provide them with enough security and said there is no need to have firearms to protect themselves.
