In Kenya and many other developing countries, unsafe abortion is the leading cause of maternal deaths. Half of all abortions, 25 million yearly as per the World Health Organization (WHO), are unsafe. 

Women and girls are forced to backstreet abortion clinics, which often results in complications such as organ failure and sepsis, and death.

Many of these cases are preventable if the Ministry of Health implemented the progressive laws, policies, guidelines and framework on abortion developed after the 2010 Constitution. Article 26(4) permits abortion when, in the opinion of a trained health professional, the mother’s life is in danger. 

A 2019 Supreme Court ruling in the “JMM” case said survivors of sexual violence, such as rape and defilement, have a right to safe abortion services. 

Standards and guidelines

The “Standards and guidelines for reducing morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion in Kenya” covers all aspects of care in preventing unsafe abortion. 

It seeks to save women from complications of abortion, where a well-designed response system would prevent permanent disabilities and deaths. 

The Health ministry-approved “Post-abortion care: A pocket guide for healthcare providers” was born of the need to equip reproductive health service providers with the necessary knowledge and skills to provide timely quality post-abortion care (PAC) services to reduce morbidity and mortality. 

Zero maternal deaths 

The ministry’s “National post-abortion care curriculum for service providers” gives guidance on training to inform quality post-abortion care services.

It is impossible for the country to achieve its commitment to the ICPD+25 goal of zero maternal deaths if public facilities continue to turn away women and girls seeking abortion services due to an unclear legal environment on service provision. 

A holistic approach and putting reproductive healthcare at the centre of universal health coverage (UHC) will ensure access to the essential abortion services to every woman who needs it.

He wisely booked a Kenya Airways flight and not an Ethiopian Airways one, as he believed the latter could be grounded any time by the government.
