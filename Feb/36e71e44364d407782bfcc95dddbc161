A female domestic worker was burnt to death after a fire gutted her employer's residential house in Nakuru's White House area on Thursday afternoon. 

Property estimated at millions of shillings was also destroyed by the inferno. 

Ms Aisha Violet, 23, was burnt beyond recognition. The incident happened as her boss, Adow Mahamoud Sheikh, was away at her work place.

"I was at my work place when a neighbour informed me that my house was on fire. I immediately abandoned my duties and rushed home. What I have found is devastating and heart-breaking. It is so unfortunate that she died in the fire," said Ms Adow. 

Ms Adow said the house-help was alone in the house as her children were in school. 

Cause not known 

The cause of the fire was not immediately established but a neighbour, Mary Wangari, told the Nation the fire might have been caused by an electric fault.
