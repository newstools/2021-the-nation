"These precise offensive operations in our area of responsibility, which we jointly conducted with the Somalia Security Forces, are part of a series of ongoing combat operations aimed at further degrading Al-Shabaab capabilities," William Nabasa, commander of Ugandan troops serving under Amisom said in a statement issued on Friday evening. 

Nabasa said Al-Shabaab had been using hideouts in Mishaani, Camp and Doonka Daafeedow locations to attack Amisom bases as well as terrorise civilians in the Lower Shabelle region.
