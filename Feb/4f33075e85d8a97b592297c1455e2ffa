Sycamore Pine Limited (“SPL”) recently launched its affordable housing development project named Samara Estate (“Samara”), located at Migaa Golf Estate in Kiambu County. The Ministry of Housing Principal Secretary, Charles Hinga, was the Chief Guest. 

The project is in line with the Housing Pillar of the Government’s Big 4 Agenda. Samara is certified as an Affordable Housing Project under Boma Yangu. 





 

The Samara Estate is a brilliantly thought-out housing project tucked away in the beautiful, green, luscious Kiambu County. The development is on 17.21 acres of land. It is set to accommodate a total of 1,824 units comprising two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments. The blocks are conveniently spaced to ensure ample natural light penetrates to every room of each unit. 

Samara is appropriately located within the gated Migaa Golf Estate, where there are over 100 families living within the community. Migga offers an 18-hole championship golf course. The back nine is playable and the front nine will be done by May 2021. Other notable amenities scheduled to be constructed within the estate are Ubora Hospital, a cardio-metabolic hospital, a primary school, and a sports centre. 

Samara is a private gated estate, proficiently designed to be a self-sufficient community. Every amenity is carefully considered. The estate perfectly blends aspects of nature, golf, family, and luxurious living; all at an affordable cost. This project offers the best of Aspirational Living!
