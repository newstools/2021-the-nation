AFC Leopards have been drawn against Taita Taveta All Stars. 
In last year's competition, which ended at Round of 16 level due to the coronavirus pandemic, Nation FC failed to progress to the round of 32 after falling 3-1 to Jericho Revelation at Camp Toyoyo Grounds in Nairobi.
Nation FC coach John Ashihundu said their target this year is to perform better than last year. “Because we have been together as a team for the last three years and all our top players are still there, we expect to perform better. We have also met the grassroots teams before, so we are equal to the task,” said Ashihundu.

In her address, FKF Vice president Doris Petra said it's exciting to have the competition back after the disruption caused by Covid-19. She urged the gaming company to extend their support to the recently launched FKF Women’s Cup.
“It is exciting to see the resumption of this competition today.  We appreciate Betway for sticking with us. It is exciting to see clubs from grassroots getting involved and giving senior clubs a run for their money. 
"I call upon everyone to be good mentors for the youth playing football and to Betway, I would like to encourage you to expand the gesture to the women’s cup,” said Petra.
