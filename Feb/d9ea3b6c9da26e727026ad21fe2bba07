"The shoe just came off at the start but I had to soldier on. The secret of my victory is hard training. I only rested for two days when the body was under the weather," said Rono, who is already dreaming of victory at the Africa Cross Country Championships due March 6 in Lome, Togo and the World Under-20 Championships planned from August 17-22 in Nairobi.
