The 2013 finalists Strathmore University Leos host Northern Suburbs in the other semi-final at the Leos varsity ground, Madaraka, Nairobi. 

The winners of the semi-finals will earn promotion where they will join either Pool “A” or Pool “B” of the Kenya Cup that gets underway on February 27. 

Both Suburbs and Masinde Muliro are out to upset the established order and make their maiden appearance in top flight rugby. 

Suburb coach Simon Jawichre noted that a few years ago, his players were featuring in age group tournaments, dreaming of one day playing in Kenya Cup.

“The opportunity has arisen and we shall give it our best shot,” Jawichre said. “We have trained and done what is required of us.” 

Jawichre knows that Strathmore is a more experienced side than his. “We shall keep focus but God for us all,” said Jawichre adding that up to 75 per cent of his players continued keeping fit during the Covid-19 pandemic period. 

The Leos coach Louis Kisia said they are approaching Suburbs with caution despite having beaten them twice during the championship. “They are definitely going to bring their A game as promotion beckons. We know what is at stake but we are upbeat, looking forward to the weekend,”said Kisia.

Kisia explained that it feels good for his charges to get back after a long break. “We have had a short preseason for four-and-a-half weeks but we hope to give a good account of ourselves,” noted Kisia.

It seems Kenyan cricket is as dead as a dodo. He was a jack of all trades playing volleyball, handball, athletics and basketball right from primary school. Four candidates from Britain, Ireland, Italy and Spain are vying to replace Gambian-born Fatou Bensouda. Nyali MP Mohamed Ali's action resulted in a debate about safety as political temperatures rise ahead of the 2022 poll. President Kenyatta says one cannot "insult people" while also taking credit for the government's success.
