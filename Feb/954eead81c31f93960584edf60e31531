“There are players who religiously followed the training programme and schedule we had given out during the coronavirus pandemic lock-down and there fitness level is there for everyone to see. But some players have to go the extra mile in the training.  
“We are, however, determined to get the work done,” said Malungu, who doubles up as the Kenya Under-21 men and Western Jaguars coach.

Kenya will battle Burundi, Libya, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda for the two Africa Cup of Nations tickets. Malungu said Uganda would pose a serious threat to Kenya in the six- nation tournament.
“Uganda are coming up pretty well if the school games are anything to go by and we cannot underrate them. While we are aware the other teams will want to prove a thing or two, we are optimistic of grabbing one of the two slots.”“Besides working on the physical state of the players, we are keen on their mental strength and, if anything, everything starts with the mind, “ said Malungu.
The tactician, who will guide the U-21 side to the Junior Africa Hockey on March 22-28 in Accra, Ghana was bullish about the senior side’s chances of qualifying for the Nations Cup.
