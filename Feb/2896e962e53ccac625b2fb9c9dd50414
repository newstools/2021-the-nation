He said three people and a driver who were in the truck were seriously injured.  They were taken to Chuka County Referral Hospital for treatment. 

“The truck was ferrying milk from Meru town when it collided head-on with the PSV that was going in the opposite direction killing five people on the spot,” said Mr Mugambi. 

Mr Jacob Munene Micheni, Chuka -Chogoria Sienta Sacco chairman, said the matatu was heading to Chogoria town when the accident happened. 

Mr Micheni said witnesses said the driver of the truck lost control as he was negotiating a sharp corner at the bridge, ramming the matatu before plunging into the river.
