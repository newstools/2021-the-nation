“The wind was to heavy and that is why I opted to stay behind before striking at the right time. I stayed behind to monitor their running style and strength and it worked well,” said Kiplimo, who is now eyeing a top 10 finish at the nationals on February 13 after finishing 20th in 2019 and 29th in 2020.
“It’s my dream to once don the national titles...I believe this year could be a break for me,” said the 21-year-old Kiplimo, who trains in Ngong.
