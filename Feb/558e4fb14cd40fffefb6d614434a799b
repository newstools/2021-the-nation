Speaking at the event, Wadau Premier League coordinator Bob Otieno said that the motive behind the formation of the league is to promote fun among football fans in the country.   

“As key stakeholders in football, we have been ignored for so long and we are just trying to create our space. So it is a good day for fans today, because apart from watching professional players play, they will also get an opportunity to play the game,” said Otieno.

Evolve Logistics Chief Executive Officer Shem Okotah said: “Sport is a big part of our industry now. It helps youth earn a living and harness their talents. Evolve Logistics is here to help develop sports in Kenya and ensure that athletes and other organisations compete smoothly while we handle transport of equipment and other things.” He says the President's support for the Sh4.5 billion car grant contributed to the outcome. Opposition says the result is an "electoral holdup" and urges the public to protest against it. Somalia, facing an electoral impasse, has seen cases of Covid-19 rise significantly this month.
