The Maseno school alumni said he is in the country to help Morans seal their place in the Afrobasket finals set fo Kigali in August.
“We have worked hard as a team to be at this stage and cannot therefore lose this golden chance to be at the Afrobasket finals after a 27 year wait," Gundo said.

Morans assistant coach Collins Sadat Gaya said he was happy that Gundo has joined the rest of the squad, adding that his presence will bolster the team's firepower.
“We have been training well and thw team’s fitness level almost at its peak. The morale is top notch since the arrival of coach Liz Mills, who is working her magic with all players " Gaya said, adding that he is personally learning a lot from the Austrlain tactician.
Gaya revealed that he is not worried over the absence of forward Airel Okal, who left the team’s training camp on Friday for Oman, where he is expected to sign for a top club after undergoing a medical.
“Yes it is true Okal left the country for Oman on Friday, but he was in real great form so getting back into the team will not be a problem when he comes back," Gaya said of the versatile KPA player, who plays all front court positions.
Team manager Maxim Milimu confirmed that France based Joel Awich, and the Denmark duo of Preston Bungei and Tylor Okari are expected to link up with the team after their Friday league matches.
