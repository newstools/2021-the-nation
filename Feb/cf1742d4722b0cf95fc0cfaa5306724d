Peter Mugo, a relative of one of the sex abuse victims, said police have been threatening him against reporting the incident to higher authorities. 

 Mr Mugo said police have been pestering him to abandon the case.

 He called upon the government to transfer all police officers at the station. 

“Residents of Matunda have lost faith in officers at this police station. It is now two weeks since we reported the incident. The suspect has been released under unclear circumstances,” said Mr Mugo.
