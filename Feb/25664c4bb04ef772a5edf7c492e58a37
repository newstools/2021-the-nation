“I am very happy winning the ladies event, though I had a good chance of winning with a better and low score if I did not bogey four holes and made only one birdie. 

My take off from the tee is excellent as I have been practising a lot, though I still need to work on my approach shots. I was struggling with anything from 100 yards to the green, but I am going to work on it as I continue with my practise sessions," said Wangari. 






She said though the Vet Lab course was playing long, she is used to it and had no problem at all with the distance. 

“I was getting where I really wanted to be with my tee shots save for my approach shots," added Wangari, who said would like to play in more ladies' open events in order to improve her game. On the other hand, the Kiambu-based Wanjiru, currently playing off handicap four, had posted 81 gross to finish second just a shot better than Faith Ontune from the Africa Golf Program.
