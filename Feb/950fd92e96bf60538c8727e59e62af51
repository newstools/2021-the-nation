National Elections Board (NEB) Chairperson Catherine Mumma announced that the deadline for the submission of applications has been extended from Friday, February 26, 2021, to March 31, 2021.

“All interested candidates are requested to submit their applications in the prescribed manner,” she said in a statement. 

Reason for extension 

Speaking to the Nation on the phone, Ms Mumma said the extension has been occasioned by the current by-elections across the country. 

ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohamed said they want ample time to concentrate on implementation of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). 

ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna earlier said that only Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho had expressed his interest before the extension of the deadline. 

Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya who, together with Mr Joho are party leader Raila Odinga’s co-deputies, also told the Nation that he is eying the ODM presidential ticket.

});
}, 62000);
}




Mr Odinga is also expected to express his interest but he has remained guarded on his 2022 plans, saying that his priority and that of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the moment is to ensure the implementation of BBI. 

The ODM leader has, however, been giving indications that he will be on the ballot and has since stated that he will not endorse any of his Nasa coalition allies.
