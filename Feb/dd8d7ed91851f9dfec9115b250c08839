IM is the second most coveted title in chess after the Grandmaster and for Ssegwanyi received the title in 2015 after winning the Zone 4.2 Individual Championship.
Speaking to Nation Sport on Sunday at Chess Kenya offices in Nairobi, Ssegwanyi exuded confidence that the national team will perform well in the continental contest. 
“Kenya is one of the most organised teams in this championship and I expect that the team will outperform the expectations. With chess, the rating is always an indication of what you are expected to score, so if you see them outperforming their rating, then they are doing better than expected. That is what I expect to happen,” said Ssegwanyi.
