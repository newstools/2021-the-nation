Seventh-placed Makolanders had no answers for Gaspo's speed and quick accurate passes throughout the first half. Airo then struck in the 68th and 74th minutes to complete her hatrick.  

Despite the win, Gaspo remain third with 13 points drawn from four wins, one draw and two losses.  

"It was a tough game but we approached it tactically. The players played according to instructions, challenging all loose balls, transiting from defence to attack with pace and intent, scored early in the game and managed to get a much needed clean sheet. Congratulations to Makolanders for their competitive mindset," said Isaac Maluki, Gaspo coach.
