It has been several months that the foreign rebellion of the ADF-Ugandan group has been carrying out simultaneous attacks in the two neighboring provinces despite military operations of the DRC supported by the UN mission. Mr Luca Attanasio was killed in an ambush in Goma on Monday. The Ituri province's interior minister Adjio Gidi said on Thursday that 23 people were killed in the region on Tuesday, and another 35 on Thursday. He has dared all those interested in the presidency to step into the ring and sell their agenda without undermining anyone. Devolution minister says that for a country to prosper, a strong foundation like the BBI is necessary.
