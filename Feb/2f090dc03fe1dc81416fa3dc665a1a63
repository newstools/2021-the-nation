But MCAs from Jubilee in Baringo County shot down he Bill last week in a sitting marred by chaos. 

A group MCAs in support of the BBI have filed an application seeking to block the decision by the county assembly to reject the bill. 

The Speaker, Bernard Wamalwa, is now tasked to send the Bill to the Speakers of the National Assembly after it was endorsed by the ward representatives. 

The Bill had been subjected to a public participation process that ran from February 9 to February 12 across the seven constituencies of Nambale, Matayos, Budalang’i, Butula, Funyula, Teso South and Teso North to collect the views of the locals. 






Busia County Assembly committee on Legal and Human Rights chairman David Kokonya tabled the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020 before the house.

 Nyamira Speaker Moffat Teya said the Bill is being subjected to public participation in all the four constituencies. 

 “The Bill has already been tabled in the house and we are currently going round the county collecting resident’s views,” said Mr Teya. 

Kakamega County Assembly Leader of Majority Mr Joel Ongoro said he wa confident that the bill would be passed. 

“We are having a sitting on Tuesday nex week and the mood among the majority of the MCAs is quite positive. I’m confident, the bill will sail through without any hitch,” said Mr Ongoro 

In Busia, only one out of the 53 members opposed the Bill during the voting session that was presided over the assembly speaker. 

 “As a county assembly, we have played our part. It is now upon the public to accept or reject the Bill,” said the Speaker, Mr Wamalwa. 

Nominated MCA Bernard Odako opposed the report claiming the public was given a short time and passed it at the public participation forums without understanding its contents. 

 “We need more time to go through the document before making informed decisions. This rush is not good for us,” argued Mr Odako. 

 Those who voted for the Bill included Leader of Majority Kassaman Ekesa, Cynthia Mutere, John Obwogo, Moses Ochieng’, Novena Ndaliro, Job Oteba, Fredrick Musirimba, Felix Omanyi and Bernard Papa.
