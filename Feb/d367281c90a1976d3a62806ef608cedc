 For ages, the financial services and products market in Kenya has been dominated by commercial banks and microfinance institutions. 

But, of late, unconventional lenders mostly premised on the online platforms and, as such, widely known as “digital lenders”, have emerged to plug the gap between increasing demand and declining access to quick credit.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}




These fancy shylocks are, in most cases not strict with credit evaluation and loan security requirements. And as the need for quick loans grows, so does the number of the lenders. 

Unfortunately, there is no law regulating them and, as expected, the industry is bloating with malpractices such as exorbitant interest rates, abuse of credit information, data privacy infringement and barbaric debt collection methods. As a result, many Kenyans continue to fall victim to these malpractices without a remedy. 






But although painfully slow, there is an initiative to regulate the sector. The Financial Markets Conducts Bill 2018 (FMC), drafted by the National Treasury, seeks to establish a Financial Markets Conduct Authority (FMCA) to license the unconventional lenders and prescribe the chargeable interest rates from time to time. 

Regulate lenders 

Unfortunately, the Bill is yet to be tabled in Parliament and has been met with opposition. For instance, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) connoted that the Bill would strip it of its powers and create dual regulators (FMCA and CBK) in the banking and financial sector. No further attempts have been made to regulate the lenders. 

On June 19, last year, the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020 (CBKA, 2020) was published and, mid this month, tabled in Parliament. It basically proposes to amend the Central Bank of Kenya Act, Cap. 491, to mandate CBK to regulate and supervise digital lenders.

});
}, 62000);
}




The need for structure in this market is not debatable. The lawmakers should, therefore, hasten their pace and conclude the legislation.
