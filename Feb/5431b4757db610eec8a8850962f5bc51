A multi-agency security team on Tuesday successfully repelled an attack at Turbi Police Station in Marsabit County.
Area acting police boss David Muthure revealed that four people opened fire on officers at the station.
“Our officers managed to fight them off and pursued the raiders to Funan Idhaa area, which we believe is a training ground and sanctuary for a dangerous militia group,” Mr Muthure said.
