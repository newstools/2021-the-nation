Elsewhere in Kericho, second half goals from Omar Boraafya and Oscar Wamalwa earned Ulinzi Stars a 2-0 win over Sofapaka.   

Bandari coach Andre Cassa Mbungo said he was happy to have won the game against his former team. 

The win took Bandari's tally to 19 points, 10 shy of leaders Tusker after 12 rounds of matches. Bandari are now sixth on the standings.

“I told my players to play their hearts out and secure maximu8m three points and I’m happy they did so. Now we want to get another victory in our next fixture so that we can be in one of the top positions and among top contenders for the league crown,” said Mbungo. 

Leopards coach Patrick Aussems said it was not their lucky day as the two mistakes committed by his defenders cost them the match. 

"For a big match like this when you commit a slight mistake in early stages, it is difficult for a comeback but I commend my players for their fighting spirit to score a goal and dominated the proceedings in almost all the second session,” said the former Simba SC tactician.

He said he was impressed with the way the players performed despite training on Thursday having missed training on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Bandari took an early lead in the third minute when Marvin Omondi's back-pass to his goalkeeper Benjamin Ochan was intercepted by Wadri, before the Ugandan midfielder dribbled past his countryman to put the ball into an empty net. 

Leopards conceded their second goal in the 11th minute in similar fashion after skipper Robinson Kamura delayed to clear the ball from the danger zone and Wadri pressed hard and won the ball before beating Ochan to give Bandari a 2-0 lead. 

Omondi halved the deficit on 22 minutes after he was teed up by Austine Odhiambo and sent a powerful shot past Bandari custodian Justin Ndikumana. 

Leopards dominated the proceedings for the better part of the second half but the Dockers stayed behind the ball to pick the maximum points. Ulinzi forward Clinton Omondi was a constant menace on their rivals’
defence. It will be the first league match for AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems. He encouraged clerics to continue interceding for the nation to defeat the pandemic.
