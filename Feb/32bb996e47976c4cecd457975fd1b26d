Defending champion Kibiwott Kandie from Kenya Defence Forces, seemed headed for another victory only for Kwemoi, the 2016 World Under-20 10,000m champion, to step on his gas pedal, zooming past the KDF man halfway the last lap. 

The 23-year-old would widen his lead to 30 metres gap as Kandie, the World Half Marathon silver medallist, laboured  to give the chase but in vain.

Kwemoi eventually romped home triumphant in 32 minutes and 03.3 seconds to toss to his maiden senior victory. 

Kandie settled second in 32:05.5 as Edwin Kibet from South Rift came in third in 32:10.9. 

Kibet attributed his victory to hard training alongside Olympic Marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and former two-time World Cross Country champion Geoffrey Kamworor. 

"Unlike before I opted to stay behind the pack to see how the leading pack behaved. I tested Kandie and the rest with two laps to go and I saw they were tired. I decided to go for it in the last lap after Kandie failed to respond," said Kwemoi. 

"It was a good race but I felt tired towards the last two laps. I tried to kick when Kwemoi overtook me in the last lap but two of the athletes, who were in front blocked me," said Kandie. 

Both Kwemoi and Kandie said they are ready for the Africa Cross Country Championships due March 6 in Lome, Togo.
