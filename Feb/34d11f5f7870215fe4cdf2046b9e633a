The 200,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were donated by China.  

Finance minister Mthuli Ncube said Zimbabwe had a target to buy at least 1.3 million doses from China in the short term. 

“Zimbabwe’s approach is to save lives first, then save lives livelihoods,” Professor Ncube said. 

Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe, Guo Shaochun, said the southern African country was among the first countries in the world to receive the Sinopharm vaccine.

“You know we have a population of 1.4 billion in China and they also need to be vaccinated,” Ambassador Guo said. 

“We are also facing enormous demand for the supply of vaccines in China, but Zimbabwe is our brother. 

“So the assistance of vaccines and the supply of vaccines to Zimbabwe is not a problem.” 

According to a schedule released by the Health and Child Care ministry, Zimbabwe will have three phases of inoculation with frontline workers and high-risk workers being given priority. 

The second phase will see the vaccination of people with chronic illnesses, the elderly and prison populations as well as those confined to settlements such as refugee camps while the final phase “will target those at relatively low risk until everyone is covered.” 

Zimbabwe says it is negotiating with different Covid-19 manufacturers, including Russia and India, as it seeks to immunise 60 per cent of the population or 10 million people to achieve herd immunity.

After a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths at the beginning of the year amid fears the highly infectious South African variant of the coronavirus  had started circulating in the country, Zimbabwe has in recent weeks witnessed a steady decline in new infections. 

On Sunday, the country recorded only 68 new cases from highs of over 1,000 a day last month. 

As of February 14, Zimbabwe had recorded 35 172 cases with 1,400 deaths and 30,601 recoveries. The limited doses will first be administered to high-risk groups. South Africa has reported the highest Covid-19-inflicted death toll in Africa, at 47,670 as of Saturday. Security agencies say there was a plan to cause chaos at Nyachae's burial. He’s appealing the 30-year sentence by claiming wrongful conviction, challenging the evidence. He will be buried at the Lang'ata Muslim Cemetery Monday afternoon.
