"In the end, my pacemaker (Luuk Maas) told me 'we can do it, let's push it'. I'm really happy with this world record!" 

The former best time of 14:44 was set by New Zealand's Sifan Hassan in 2019, also in the Principality. 

The men's race was won by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei in 13:13, well outside his own world record of 12:51 established in Monaco 12 months ago.  Cherotich came in second in 35:00.5 but after a thrilling battle with Chepng'etich who came in third in 35:02.1. Kamworor did not complete the race. Traders and youths accused the DP of insulting and demeaning President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kyagulanyi’s legal team is seen as generally lightweight and the petitioner appears short on resources. In what is set to be another blow to the Karume empire, the 128-room, four-star Jacaranda Hotel is set to go under the hammer on March 12.
