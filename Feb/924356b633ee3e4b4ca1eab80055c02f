The development left six players seriously injured with 12 others nursing minor injuries. 

The team, which is placed ninth on the log with three points from three matches in the thirteen-team league, was set to play Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Forest Service  and  Prisons Mombasa. 

KVF assistant organising secretary John Ajole confirmed the move saying they have had to re draft the fixtures after the development.

"The players are traumatised and we have to give them time to recover.  As a federation, we wish the players involved in the road accident quick recovery and the team at largel," Ajole. He says he will spare no effort in the realisation of the shared aspirations that revived the EAC 20 years ago.
