"We quickly called for a motorbike that rushed him to Nzoia dispensary where they referred him to Bungoma County Referral Hospital where he died while being treated,” she said.

Illegal 'marriage'?
Leah Nekesa, Brian’s mother, said her husband - who was a church leader - had received a phone call informing him that the police were hunting for his son for allegedly marrying a class seven pupil.
Ms Nekesa said the girl's parents were demanding that Brian be arrested for making their daughter drop out of school. 
She said that later on, after they had had supper, she was called by her in-laws who informed her that their son had attacked his father and he had been rushed to hospital for treatment. 
“I wanted to come with him but he told me just to wait till morning,” she said.
Ms Nekesa disclosed that their first born was very unruly and kept what she described as bad company. Brian, she said, smoked marijuana and drank illicit brew with them. 
She also noted that Brian was unhappy that his father had sold land and had refused to give him his share.
Liru Katani, the area assistant chief of Namirembe, concurred that Brian notorious in the area, and that they had tried to persuade him to go to school but he had refused.
“We have been working to ensure that all pupils from this area are back to school but Brian has really given us a headache,” he said.
