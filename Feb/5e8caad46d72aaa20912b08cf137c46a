The hugely anticipated meet will bring together 16 teams from across the country with the squad members seeking selection to the Kenya team for the Africa Cross Country Championships that will be held in Lome, Togo on March 6 and 7.

Different regions and the disciplined forces selected their best teams for the national trials and it will be indeed the crème de la crème of Kenyan long distance running on display at the racecourse on Saturday.
Sample this. National champion Sheila Chelangat will headline the 10km senior women’s after the Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Half Marathon race that she intended to compete in on February 19 was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.





Chelangat, who won the National Police Service Cross Country Championships title in Nairobi, has been training in Kericho.
“It will be a tough race because all the athletes have shifted their focus to the event since there is no other race to participate in at this time. I’m equally prepared and I will be looking forward to a good race and hopefully retaining my title,” said Chelangat.
Eyes will also be on the Kenya Prisons Service senior champions Rosemary Wanjiru and Charles Yosei.
Wanjiru who has been juggling her training between Eldoret and Iten is confident that she will carry the day come Saturday.
“I have been in the country for some time now and my main target is win,” Wanjiru threw down the gauntlet to her rivals loud and clear.
Yosei, who hails from Mt Elgon in Bungoma County, said he was well prepared after recovering from an injury that had kept him out of action for a while.

“I have been training really hard because I know I will be competing with some of the best athletes in the world,” said Yosei.
In-form Kibiwott Kandie, who is also the Kenya Defence Forces Cross Country champion will also be in the mix after the RAK meet was called off.
Race categories are 10km senior men and women, 8km under-20 men, 6km under-18 boys, 6km under-20 women, 5km under-18 girls and 8km mixed relay.
Nairobi Athletics Kenya Chairman Barnaba Korir, said preparations for the national championships are complete and they expect teams to start arriving in Nairobi from tomorrow.
All athletes under 20 years who will run on Saturday are expected to attend an anti-doping seminar in Nairobi. He underlined his intentions obvious ahead of the National Cross Country Championships. She is also eager to represent Kenya in 10,000m at the Tokyo Olympic Games later this year. There is still no funding for the upcoming referendum and Uhuru’s recent Sh4 billion-sweetheart car grant deal to MCAs. Triton was given undue advantage over other players even before the implementation of the CFAs began. The West bought billions of vaccines fast and cheap, leaving poorer nations paying through the nose for years to come.
