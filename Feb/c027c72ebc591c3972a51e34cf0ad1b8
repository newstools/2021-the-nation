Bandari picking up well under Rwandan coach Mbungo, KCB falterAfter midweek matches Tusker are surely the title favourites but coach Matano says these are still early days After Tusker’s come-from-behind win over Nzoia Sugar midweek this is how their impressive statistics read. 

Won their last seven matches. Unbeaten in their last 12 outings. Won 10 of their last 11 matches. Twenty-five goals scored, the most prolific by a team in the league. Two-one conquerors of league champions Gor Mahia.

Not surprising they are perched on top of the 18-team Football Kenya Federation Premier League table, six points higher than their closest rivals. 

Still,  Tusker coach Robert ‘The Lion” Matano is not convinced yet that his charges can bag their first league title in five years. 

The veteran tactician has instead called on his players to be more consistent and fight for every match. 

The brewers on Tuesday continued to bubble with wins, coming from a goal behind to beat Nzoia Sugar 2-1 at Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani.

Teen sensation Henry Meja scored the late winner, his eighth goal of the season after Jackson Macharia had cancelled out Hillary Simiyu’s opener. 

“It is still very early in the league and there are still 21 matches to go but we have to keep working hard and delivering results. The most important thing now is to be consistent. Position now doesn't matter a lot because even KCB at one time were leading with a six-point gap, but where are they now?” posed Matano. 

 Matano can take confidence from the way his side has picked up tight wins in large part due to his tactical brilliance on game strategy. 

Of the 12 matches played so far, Tusker has won eight on a one goal margin. They came from behind to thump Nzoia Sugar and Zoo Kericho and draw 1-1 with Sofapaka.

});
}, 62000);
}




“You can’t judge us on that because a win is a win. In football it is the three points which count even if the goal is scored in the last minute,” added the 59-year-old tactician. 

Teen Meja has been brilliant in front of goal. 

“The team has a fighting spirit and it is not all about an individual, that is what has inspired us to win as I also hunt for my goals,” said Meja, who is four goals shy of leading scorer Erick Kapaito of Kariobangi Sharks. 

KCB and AFC Leopards, who are on 22 and 26 points respectively,  continue to heap pressure on Tusker. 

The bankers, however, dropped points in a 2-2 draw against Sofapaka at Wundanyi Stadium on Wednesday. 

KCB coach Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno said they were feeling the absence of dependable midfielder Michael Mutinda who was red carded in the 2-1 loss against 13th placed Nzoia Sugar last weekend. 

“Mutinda is an important player to us and we missed him a lot but we are not out of the title races the league is becoming tough and we have to continue fighting,” Otieno said. 

Bandari are also picking up under Rwandan coach Casa Mbung’o and are fourth on 22 points after a 5-0 thrashing of league returnees Vihiga United on Tuesday while bottom placed Zoo earned a point in a 1-1 draw with Kakamega Homeboyz Wednesday.

} KCB has also contributed six players. Substitute Peter Thiong'o grabbed the winner in the second half. The Attorney-General had argued that the court has no authority to address the issues raised by Mr Miguna in the petition. Key allies are pulling in three different directions. Some are telling him to back it, others say oppose it, yet others want him to be neutral. It will cost Kenyan taxpayers an extra Sh3.7bn every year to carter for the proposed seats in Parliament in the BBI Bill, analysts say.
