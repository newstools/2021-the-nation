The anticipated 100m battle between national 100m record holder Mark Otieno and Ferdinand Omanyala, who ran the fastest on Kenyan soil since Chidi Imo (10.10, wind assisted) during the 1997 African Games, won’t happen.
Omanyala, who clocked wind-assisted 10.11seconds and Boniface Mweresa, who competed in 200m, have been left out by Athletics Kenya owing to their past anti-doping rules violation. Both sprinters have finished serving doping bans not exceeding two years.
Initially, AK senior vice-president Paul Mutwii had indicated that those completing doping bans can still take part in locally organised events but not when national teams are being selected.
However, an executive meeting on February 3 meeting resolved to ban them altogether but they can still secure other races outside the country.
Otieno, who holds the national records of 10.14, clocked the second fastest time in the previous leg of 10.32. He highlights the second heat that has Pius Muia (10.98) and Mathew Elijah (10.85). The men’s 100m has four heats. However, he admitted his car was one of the three involved in the macabre accident.
