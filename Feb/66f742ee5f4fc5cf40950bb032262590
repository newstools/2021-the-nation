Coast Stima FC coach Hussein Madaga commended his players for the win despite the numerous problems they are facing due to lack of sponsorship.  

"I believe we will continue to do well but we request well-wishers to come forward and help us so that we can successfully travel to Kisumu for our next fixture. We want to honour all our matches," said Madaga. 

Talanta FC coach Ken Kenyatta complained about the tough weather conditions due to the match kicking off at 1pm. 

"The sad thing is that the game started at 1pm on a hot day. Why couldn’t kick-off be at 4pm or at least 3pm?” posed Kenyatta.
