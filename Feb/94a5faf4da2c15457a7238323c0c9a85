Kenya Cup’s Pool “A” will have Kabras Sugar, Impala Saracens, Mwamba, Blak Blad, Kenya Harlequin while KCB highlight Pool “B” that has Homeboyz, Menengai Oilers, Nakuru, Nondescripts. The KRU Championship finalists will join either pool.
In adherence with Covid-19 protocols, the Union said in a statement that no fans will be allowed into the match venue.
The KRU Championship play-offs will mark the resumption of rugby after 11 months.
KRU chief executive officer, Thomas Odundo said even though they are ready to resume, they still face challenges of testing players and other Covid-19 protocols.

“The Union and clubs don’t have money for testing but we are exploring to see how clubs can overcome these bottlenecks,” said Odundo adding that unlike football where testing is done once a month, rugby will be required to conduct them twice a month.
Odundo said they will spend Sh18 million to test 50 players the whole season hence the need for sponsors to come on board.
"Nakuru and Kakamega counties have two teams each in Kenya Cup. We want to engage these county governments to help test the players. We shall approach the Nairobi County government to also assist," said Odundo adding that Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) have helped conduct free Covid-19 tests for national Sevens teams. At the peak of its game, SportPesa made half a million shillings every minute from betting-hungry Kenyans. After agreeing to a plea deal, Gregory Dow, 61, was sentenced in a US federal court to 188 months in prison. The BBI team has set a March 1 deadline for county assemblies to consider the Bill.
