A former Olympic swimmer who won a silver medal for Australia was arrested Tuesday and charged with running a syndicate trafficking in the drug "ice", police said. 

Scott Miller, 45, and an accomplice were arrested in police raids in two Sydney suburbs. 

They were charged with the alleged supply of some AU$2.0 million (US$1.6 million) worth of methylamphetamine, also known as ice, concealed inside candles, they said.
