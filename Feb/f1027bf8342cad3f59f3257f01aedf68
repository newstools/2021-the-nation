Vote MCAs out 

Rongai MP Raymond Moi asked Baringo residents to punish the MCAs who voted to reject the Bill, by not re-electing them next year. 

"The MCAs must remember they have been elected by wananchi and therefore they must listen to what they are saying and serve the interests of the electorate. I call upon residents of Baringo to vote out these MCAs next year," the MP said. 






"BBI has got very many benefits and the MCAs should not pretend to be representing the people of Baringo when we know they are only taking care of their selfish interests," he added. 

Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat also wondered why the MCAs decided to reject the document, which he said aims at bringing inclusivity and more resources to the grassroots.

Constitutional amendments 

"Baringo people, I am sorry. I cry for you. When other county assemblies have allocated time for public participation, Baringo MCAs decided to shoot down the Bill without allowing residents to have a say. This is very unfortunate. We are confident Baringo people will endorse the constitutional amendments during the referendum," Mr Salat said.
