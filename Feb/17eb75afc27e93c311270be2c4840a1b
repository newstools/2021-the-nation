The 18 are required record statements between February 22-24, at the commission’s regional offices in Nakuru. 

The letter was addressed to the assembly's clerk. 

Copies of the Hansard 

EACC has also asked the clerk of the assembly to furnish the commission with copies of the Hansard for February 11, a report of the steps so far taken in respect of the incident and any other information relating to the incident. 

"Facilitate the officers to come to our regional offices; our investigators will be available to collect documents, interview and record statements,” further reads the letter. 

During the chaotic assembly sitting, some 30 Jubilee Party MCAs voted against the Bill, while 11 others allied to the independence party Kanu voted in its favour. 

The assembly has 45 MCAs with 32 from the ruling Jubilee party. Kanu has 10 members. There are two independents and one ODM ward representative. 

Jubilee-Kanu rivalry also played out during the session to consider the Bill. The Bill was tabled in the assembly on February 9 by Leader of Majority Lawi Kipchumba.
