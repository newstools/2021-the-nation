 CAA postponed the Africa Cross Championships that was slated for March 6-7 in Lome, Togo without indicating the new dates for the event. 

 The African body cited the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the west African country as the reason that led to the putting off of the event for a second time.  Team Kenya, comprising 46 athletes and 10 officials, was selected on February 13 during the Lotto National Cross Country Championships at the Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi before proceeding for residential training on February 17 at Kigari Teachers Training College, in Embu

“We received the communication from CAA yesterday and we do not have a clear date on when the event will be held and whether Togo will still host it. In the next few days we should have a clear decision from CAA,” said Tuwei. 

“At the moment, most of the African countries have already selected their teams for the event and they are already in camp. So our team will continue training at the Kigari Teachers Training Camp, as we wait for the final communication.” 

 Tuwei further indicated that some African countries are on standby should Togo pull out from hosting the championship. 

 “We have to salvage the championships because cross country is such an important race for athletes. Being an Olympic year, there is need to give the athletes opportunities to compete as much as possible,” said Tuwei.

 Tuwei urged the athletes not to be demoralised but instead go on with their normal training programme as directed by their coaches. 

The team received their local allowances on Wednesday and were kitted yesterday. 

Meanwhile, the opening leg of the Athletics Kenya track and field meeting will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium tomorrow and Sunday. 

The event that was to be hosted by Nyanza North Region was initially set for Bondo University in Siaya County before being moved to Maseno University. 

It was later called off before Nairobi Region stepped in to host it. “I think the universities saw it unwise to host crowds during these coronavirus times which is perfect with us. For the athletes, it might be a blessing in disguise to use world class facilities in Nairobi before the Olympics,” said Tuwei.

Key allies are pulling in three different directions. Some are telling him to back it, others say oppose it, yet others want him to be neutral. It will cost Kenyan taxpayers an extra Sh3.7bn every year to carter for the proposed seats in Parliament in the BBI Bill, analysts say.
