Some 1,200 doses of vaccines for the Ebola virus have been sent to the city of Butembo in North Kivu, the DR Congo, where two people have died since a resurgence was reported on Sunday. 

In its latest report on the 12th epidemic that was published on Friday, Doctor Nzanzu Syalita Eugène, the provincial minister of health of North Kivu, said cold chain equipment, for storing the vaccines at the recommended temperature, were also sent to Butembo.

The Ebola is often reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The last wave in Equateur province, which was declared defeated in November 2020, killed more than 50 people. 

In the province of North Kivu, the last wave was defeated in March 2020 after killing more than 2,000 people. This comes just three months after authorities declared the end of the country's previous outbreak. WHO says the ongoing response would not be enhanced" by an emergency declaration.
