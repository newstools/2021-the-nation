Witnesses said the matatu was carrying 16 passengers, instead of 14 or less, considering restrictions to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

"The driver lost control of the vehicle after one of its rare tyres burst while he attempted to overtake," one of the witnesses said. 

The bodies were taken to the Makueni hospital mortuary.
