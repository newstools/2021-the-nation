Gaspo head coach Isaac Maluki said he was glad with the win.
“We have continuously felt like we are not delivering the way we are supposed to in our last couple of matches and so we came in prepared both physically and mentally for the game and took advantage of the open opportunities presented to us. We are now back on track and expect to maintain this momentum from now on,” he said.

Ulinzi Starlets coach Joseph Mwanza told Nation Sport that the loss was as a result of some of their best players.
In the other only match of the day, Zone B’s sides Trans Nzoia Falcons and Oserian Ladies drew 1-1 in a closely contested match at the Oserian Grounds in Naivasha.
"Our result was as a result of fatigue. We got to Naivasha a few hours before the match and didn't have a place to rest or even start training," said Chris Mfede, Trans Nzoia Falcons coach.
Trans Nzoia are second in Zone B, level on points with leaders Vihiga Queens. Bottom placed Oserian have one point from five losses and one draw.
