“I asked the Kenya Basketball Federation to allow me some time off to work with my new team which I joined last month because I want to first lay a very strong foundation that will enable APR to return to its glory days”, Owuor said.
Owuor said his heart was clean after talking to Mills and his assistant Collins Gaya during his brief visit to the country last week.
“I am in constant communication with the players and members of the technical bench and have made it very clear that I will be available for any form of support they will need from me,” said Owuor, who returned to his Kigali base on Wednesday.
