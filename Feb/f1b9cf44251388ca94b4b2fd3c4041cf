The towering defender made more than 200 appearances during his five year stay at K'Ogalo.
Some of the Kenyan players who have turned out of Nkana in the past are Duncan Otieno, Mohammed and Anthony Akumu.
At Gor, the 27 year old defender will be expected to reinforce the shaky defence which conceded a cumulative of 10 goals against APR  of Rwanda and CAlgeria's R Belouizdad in the Caf Champions League. In the Football Kenya Premier League Gor has already conceded 10 goals in eight matches.
K'Ogalo has been struggling at the back since the departure of Joash 'Berlin Wall' Onyango, who joined Tanzanian giants Simba SC in August last year.
Shakava's first match could be Sunday's 'Mashemeji' Derby against arch rivals AFC Leopards at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.
He is also eligible to play for the record champions in the Caf Confederation Cup playoff where they have been drawn against another Zambian side Napsa Stars.
