Garissa in particular will forever miss his guidance. He was a man who advocated for peace and harmony among the pastorals commuinities during his lifetime. At a personal level, He was my father, my senator, political mentor, adviser and above all, leader of my community.— Hon. Aden Duale, EGH, MP (@HonAdenDuale) February 15, 2021

Oparanya (@GovWOparanya) February 15, 2021 He will be buried at the Lang'ata Muslim Cemetery Monday afternoon. For this career administrator, anything that touches on security is not for the cameras. Security agencies say there was a plan to cause chaos at Nyachae's burial. He’s appealing the 30-year sentence by claiming wrongful conviction, challenging the evidence. He will be buried at the Lang'ata Muslim Cemetery Monday afternoon.
