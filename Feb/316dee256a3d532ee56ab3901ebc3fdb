Breakthrough 

The resumption is a breakthrough for the airline which has been severely affected by travel restrictions in many countries in Europe in efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. 

KQ and Alitalia are partner airlines in the SkyTeam Airline Alliance and have a codeshare agreement connecting their networks from their respective hubs in Nairobi and Rome. 

This means that flights by the two airlines will have one-stop connections through Rome to the rest of Italy, Europe and USA, as well as through Nairobi to the rest of Kenya and Africa. 

This includes key destinations such as Mombasa, Seychelles (including Vanilla Islands), Mauritius, Victoria Falls, Johannesburg, Cape Town and Zanzibar. 

“Our codeshare partnership with Alitalia offers our customers excellent connections in Rome and Nairobi," Mr Thairu said.
