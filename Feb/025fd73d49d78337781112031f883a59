KRU had earlier indicated that the KRU Championship final wouldn't be played, but instead, the two teams will proceed to Kenya Cup. 

The Leos landed two converted tries and three penalties to tame Suburbs, who managed two penalties. 

Arnold Muita, who was the star of the match and Philemon Olang scored a try each before Muita converted them both besides curling over a penalty. Andrew Matoka stabbed home Leos with two other penalties.

Tony Fidels found the sticks for Suburbs but all was in vain as their dream of making it to their first Kenya Cup came tumbling down. 

Three converted tries through Tyson Juma, Venance Shikuba and Timothy Mmasi took Mmust to Kenya Cup, joining the 2016 champion Kabras Sugar as the other team from Western in the prestigious league. 

Mmasi ensured Mmust are home and dry with two conversions as Juma added one. 

Machine’s points came from Festus Shiasi’s boot, chalking two penalties and two drop goals. 

“We are ecstatic...the players are happy since they believe the kind of rugby they play fits in no other league but the Kenya Cup,” said Louis Kisia. “As we try to reflect about our achievements, our season’s target is to finish in the top five.” 

The Kenya Cup is due to kick off on February 27.

} Both Suburbs and Masinde Muliro are out to upset the established order. The KRU Championship play-offs will mark the resumption of rugby after 11 months. The International Court of Justice says the case will begin as scheduled, with oral proceedings taking place on March 15 -19. DP says he will continue respecting the decisions of the President because he is "the one in charge and who calls the shots". The country has introduced a 1,000-pound note to ease transactions but experts say it will not help the economy much.
