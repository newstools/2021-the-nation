Makokha will jostle for the sole slot up for grabs in the libero department alongside regulars Aggripina Kundu( Kenya Pipeline) and Elizabeth Wanyama (Kenya Prisons), who were part of the team that qualified for Olympics last year in Cameroon.  

"Makokha's call up to the national team is actually a boost to our team in terms of morale to other players. Her call up goes to show that anybody can get an opportunity to join the national team. We are extremely humbled that we have two players in the squad and we wish them well going forward," the coach said.
