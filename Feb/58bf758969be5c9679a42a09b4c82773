According to the decision, the relieved ministers will remain in their ministries as caretaker ministers until the new government is formed.
Earlier on Sunday, the Council of Transitional Period Partners in Sudan agreed to announce the new government on Monday.
The peace deal signed by the Sudanese government and armed groups in Juba, South Sudan, on October 3, 2020, stipulated involvement of the signatory groups in the transitional period structures, including the sovereign council, the cabinet and the legislative council.
