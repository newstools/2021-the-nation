Britain's Prince William has branded racist abuse directed at footballers "despicable" and said it "must stop now" after Manchester United's Marcus Rashford became the latest player to be targeted.
William, who is the president of the Football Association, spoke out on Sunday after the Professional Footballers' Association accused social media companies of lacking the willingness to clamp down on racist posts.

"Every effort must be taken to protect them (professional footballers), and all other users, from racist abuse while using social media," it said in a statement.
"Offline consequences for online hate crimes must be pursued whenever possible."
Greater Manchester Police said a number of abusive comments directed at United players had been reported and the force would be "investigating these crimes thoroughly".
