The NMS has been re-carpeting and tarmacking roads in the city centre and surrounding areas. 

Last September, the agency said it intends to speed up road repairs across the capital following the completion of a new asphalt (bitumen) plant along Kangundo Road. 

The plant produces 2,400 tonnes of bitumen daily, enough to re-carpet three kilometres of road. 

Nairobi County has been relying on asphalt from a plant along Nanyuki Road in Industrial Area, which produces only 150 to 300 tonnes of asphalt a day.

So far, NMS has re-carpeted roads in the Nairobi central business district including City Hall way, Moi Avenue, Wabera Street with Grogon and Kirinyaga roads, which are nearing completion. 

Kenyatta Avenue, Wabera and Muindi Mbingu streets have also been transformed into non-motorised transport corridors with pedestrian and cycle paths added. 

The goal is to ensure the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. 

NMS and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) have also begun constructing 408 kilometres of access roads in informal settlements in Nairobi. 

The areas that will benefit are Kawangware, Riruta, parts of Dagoretti North, Mathare, Kangemi, Mukuru, Kibera, parts of Githurai 44 and 45, Mwiki and Zimmermann. 

Access roads in the areas have been upgraded to bitumen standards.
