Dennis Schroder scored 21 points, Talen Horton-Tucker had 17 for the defending NBA champions who improved to 17-6 on the season.
Anthony Davis said the Lakers had to make some adjustments at halftime, especially with their defence.
"We were not getting any stops. We knew we could score at will but we needed to get some stops. Guys talked in locker room and we were able to come out in that third quarter and hold them to 13 points," said Davis.

The depleted Blazers won despite an array of injuries that got worse earlier Thursday with the announcement that marquee player Damian Lillard was ruled out of the contest with an abdominal strain that had been hampering him for several games.
Portland only had nine players available. They were was also missing Jusuf Nurkic (broken wrist), CJ McCollum (broken foot) and Derrick Jones (sprained foot), among others.
But the Trail Blazers are deep in talent and it showed against the Sixers as Gary Trent scored 24 points and Swiss Enes Kanter finished with 17 points and 18 rebounds in the win at the Wells Fargo Center arena.
"On both ends of the floor, the other guys did an amazing job today," said Kanter.
Anthony shot eight of 14, dished out five assists and drained three of four threes.
Despite the revolving door on the infirmary this season, the Blazers have managed to win 12 of their first 20 games, including Thursday's shocker over the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference.
"It was just a different energy with the team," Portland's C.J. Elleby said.

Embiid scored 31 of his points in the first half after an injury scare. Embiid hyperextended his knee in the first quarter after landing awkwardly while playing defence. He limped off the floor to receive medical treatment but returned after about three minutes.

Elsewhere, Kelly Oubre exploded for a career-high 40 points as the visiting Golden State Warriors overpowered the Dallas Mavericks 147-116 in the opener of a two-game set.
