Jamii Telecommunications Limited (JTL), previously known as a provider of office and home internet, has, upon launching its mobile business, introduced Kenya’s first SIM embedded devices (eSIM). 

With the eSim technology, consumers do not have to worry about losing their lines when their phones are lost or stolen. Swapping of network providers or having multiple plans on one devices is also simplified.   

The eSIM is particularly beneficial to regular flyers who must often insert a local physical SIM every time they enter a new country. An eSIM embedded device will automatically recognise a new network, allowing users to switch seamlessly. 

“eSIM devices are ideal for folks who want multiple SIM cards but on a single device,” JTL states. 

eSIM-capable smartphones available and supported by JTL include Google Pixel 3, 3 XL, Pixel 4, 4 XL as well as Apple iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone XS, XS Max, iPhone XR and Samsung S20 series. 

JTL says in a statement that its Faiba mobile service allows users with active data bundles to make calls at no cost while availing the most competitive mobile data packages. 

“You will only need to pay Ksh150 at our dealers and outlets to port your existing number to your eSIM. However, if you are a new Faiba client, you will only need to activate your line by paying Ksh300 to use the eSIM,” reads part of the statement. Traders and youths accused the DP of insulting and demeaning President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kyagulanyi’s legal team is seen as generally lightweight and the petitioner appears short on resources. In what is set to be another blow to the Karume empire, the 128-room, four-star Jacaranda Hotel is set to go under the hammer on March 12.
