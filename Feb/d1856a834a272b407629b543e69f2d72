Chelsea boss Tuchel has tipped the "humble" midfielder to rediscover his aggressive, ball-winning best form.
"I'm absolutely not concerned about his quality," Tuchel said. "From what I see on the pitch in games and what I see on the pitch at Cobham, it's everything I expected -- and I expected a lot, I can tell you.
"I'm a huge fan and I can see the input he has on teams, he makes teams better, he makes guys around him feel comfortable.
