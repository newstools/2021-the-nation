Bidco lost their last match 2-0 to Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu Stadium on January 26.
His opposite number, Sammy 'Pamzo' Omollo has however bemoaned lack of goals from his strikers, which has seen the team record eight draws this season.
The coach has been playing Ezekiel Okare and former Gor Mahia forward Dennis Oalo upfront, but the former is yet to score this season, while the latter has only two goals to his account.
"I'm shopping for a striker this transfer window because lack of goals has been our main undoing in every game. We have been creating chances, but not scoring goals since Okare and Oalo are yet to hit form like last season," said the former Kenyan international.
"The two have to work hard whenever they are handed a starting role. Against Bidco, we have to put up a spirited fight and utilise our chances. They are not an easy team even if this is their first season in the top flight league," added Omollo.
