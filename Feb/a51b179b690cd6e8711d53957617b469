Francis Rogoi, Okutoyi’s coach, attributed her rise to the work she put in during the pandemic.
“She was very focused and had great work ethics, not forgetting the discipline even in the most difficult times. She deserves the rise by winning 10 singles in a row in two weeks,” said Rogoi, as he disclosed Okutoyi’s next stop is the ITF Centre in Casablanca in Morocco next week.
