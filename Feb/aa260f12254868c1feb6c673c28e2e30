Tiger Woods is not facing charges of reckless driving following the car crash in which he suffered serious leg injuries, authorities said Wednesday. 

"A reckless driving charge has a lot of elements into it, this is purely an accident," Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters.

He added that the most Woods could face would be a low-level offense known as an infraction if investigators conclude that he was not paying attention or speeding. 

"There'll be a cause of it, and there'll be a vehicle code attached to the cause, if it's inattentive driving whatever the case may be. 

"But that's an infraction and a reckless driving is actually more than an infraction. That's a misdemeanor crime that has a lot of elements attached to it and there's nothing, nothing like that," said Villanueva.

The sheriff said he hoped the brand new SUV was equipped with an in-vehicle data recorder that may help shed some light on the cause of the accident. 

"We're hoping obviously there's going to be... this black box and we'll have some information about the speed. It will may be a factor in this accident."

Woods received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump in 2019. Woods did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The cost of running the SGR was the highest in 2019, hitting Sh18bn against the Sh13.5bn in revenues generated for the year. The President and Mr Odinga are expected to launch the nationwide Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) campaigns on Monday. The DP has poked holes in the BBI but has refused to oppose it outright even under pressure from some of his allies.
