Sexual offence
In 2016, Busia Woman Representative Ms Florence Mutua brought amendments to the Sexual Offences Act, 2006, among them prohibition of plea bargaining.
The Bill had proposed that any person initiating or conniving to conceal a sexual offence should face a jail term of five years or be fined Sh500,000.
This crime would be in the form of soliciting money, domestic animals or any other property as compensation from the suspect, marrying off the victim to the suspected offender, preventing police officers from conducting investigations or distorting evidence, as elaborated in the Bill.
The Bill, however, failed to pass in February 2017, due to lack of two-thirds majority of MPs in favour of the proposed law.
