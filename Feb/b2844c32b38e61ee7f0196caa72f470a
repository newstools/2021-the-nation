The Pangani Housing Project is an initiative by the Nairobi City County Government in partnership with Tecnofin Kenya Limited to recreate Pangani Estate in Nairobi. The project involves building dignified and affordable homes. It is part of the Nairobi City County Urban Housing Renewal Development, and it is in line with the National Government’s Big 4 agenda under the Affordable Housing pillar. 

The original Pangani Estate was developed in the 1950s. It accommodated 48 residents on a vast 5.2-acre property. The Pangani Housing Project is increasing the number of units on this property to meet the growing demand for housing in the capital city. 

Pangani is strategically located. It is close to various key facilities, including schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, malls, clubs and parks, and a police and a fire station. 

Reconstruction of the estate is ongoing. Once complete, the project will have a mix of 1,562 residential units coupled with various commercial amenities to serve the residents. 

The project is set to offer exceptional value as a world-class enclave of convenience, affordability and modern living.
