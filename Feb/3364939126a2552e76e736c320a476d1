Five high school students accused of setting a dormitory on fire, and causing the destruction of property worth Sh6.6 million, were on Friday charged with arson.
The students of Karumandi Boys' Secondary School in Kirinyaga County appeared before Gachugu Senior Resident Magistrate Ken Odhiambo.
They denied committing the offence on February 3 and were released on Sh200,000 bond each with sureties of the same amount.

}



However, they remained in police custody as they could not secure their release.
The case will be mentioned on February 9, with investigating officer Dennis Sailel expected to present four witnesses.
“Four students are willing to testify in the case. They will serve as prosecution witnesses when the trial kicks off," he said Police boss Anthony Wanjuu says preliminary investigations showed that the students burnt the dormitory. The suspects are being held at the Murang'a police station and will be arraigned, officials say. However, he admitted his car was one of the three involved in the macabre accident.
