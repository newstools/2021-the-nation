Time in Kenya 

During his time in Kenya, Mr Diop found himself in the headlines after late former First Lady Lucy Kibaki dramatically disrupted a farewell party at his Nairobi home. 

An angry Ms Kibaki invaded the house in Muthaiga demanding that the loud music be switched off.  

At that time, musicians Mercy Myra, Eric Wainaina and Suzanne Kibukosya were on stage entertaining the guests.
