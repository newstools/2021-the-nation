The warning indicates that Britam expects a revenue shortfall of at least Sh855 million in its 2020 financial results.
The drop is attributed to lower returns from equities investments coupled with slow business in the real estate market for property and mortgages, due to market disruptions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In 2019, the group registered a profit of Sh3.5 billion on the back of higher gains on investments, recovering from a Sh2.2 billion loss in 2018.
