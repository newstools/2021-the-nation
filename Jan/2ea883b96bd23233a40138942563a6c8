Kenya relies mainly on imports of wheat as the country does not produce enough to meet the annual demand.
Effective this month, wheat products such as bread were moved from zero-rated to exempt VAT status, denying manufactures a tax refund.
“If the import duty on the wheat is waived, this will go a long way in protecting the consumers. It is a major intervention that would work well as we do not have control over the rising cost of the commodity internationally,” said the millers.





Price controls
Millers have also opposed any possible price control to tame the price of wheat products, saying that it will not work well in Kenya’s economy. 
The government indicated last week that it was monitoring the rising cost of commodities as it mulls intervention to tame the effects of the price increase.
Economist Tony Watima sided with the processors saying to save the Kenyans from the current high cost of living, the government would have extended the tax relief measure to the citizens to enable them cope with the rising prices of the commodities.
“A tax relief would enable households to have more disposable income that they can spend in the economy and help its recovery,” said Mr Watima.
