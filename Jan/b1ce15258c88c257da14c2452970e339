Anne Mwenda was on Friday sworn-in as Nairobi County's third deputy governor following a swift confirmation process by ward representatives earlier in the day.
The county assembly accepted a report from the vetting committee approving Ms Mwenda's nomination by Mike Sonko, who has since been impeached as governor.

Ms Mwenda, who was the Nairobi Disaster Management and Coordination chief office, was vetted in a session that lasted slightly more than one hour. 
The deputy governor office had been vacant since Polycarp Igathe resigned in January 2018, citing an inability to gain Sonko's trust, which he said would affect his ability to serve the city effectively.
Before Sonko's administration was the team governed by Evans Kidero, with Jonathan Mueke as the deputy governor.
