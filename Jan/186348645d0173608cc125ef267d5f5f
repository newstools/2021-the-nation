The report comes in the wake of an announcement on Wednesday by Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi that teachers would be among those to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, alongside health workers and police officers.
“Teachers are frontline workers and will receive vaccines once we roll them out,” said Dr Mwangangi.
Covid-19 infections have started rising, with the Health ministry yesterday announcing one death and 230 more infections, bringing the total to 98, 184.





The TSC is worried that the reopening of schools makes them potential super-spreaders and would, therefore, ensure that tutors are safe.
Chief executive Nancy Macharia said all efforts are being made to ensure that teachers currently under medical attention receive the best care “so they return to their full health and resume normal services of attending to learners”.
Ms Macharia said the TSC is also working with other stakeholders to ensure the wellbeing of teachers and measures are in place to ensure their safety.
Kenya has 337,432 teachers serving in more than 30,000 public primary and post-primary schools.
Ms Macharia said the commission had negotiated with the medical insurance provider Minet to cover all teachers who may suffer from the virus.

Field officers
“The commission’s field officers are also working with stakeholders in the health sector to provide psycho-social support to all teachers who may require the service,” she said.
Ms Macharia advised teachers aged 58 and above to work from home as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
She said even though the Education ministry has not issued a circular to implement the directive, the TSC would not sack any teacher with underlying conditions for working from home.
There are more than 25,000 teachers aged over 58.
Ms Macharia said the TSC had put in place measures to protect teachers from Covid 19 in conjunction with the Health ministry and counties.
Meanwhile, the Unicef has asked schools to observe Covid-19 health protocols to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Chief of Education Kenya, Marilyn Hoar, said the health guidelines are global safety precautions issued by the World Health Organisations, which are key to keeping children safe in schools.
“Unicef welcomes the reopening of schools in Kenya, our call for schools is to do everything possible to ensure children are not infected,” said Dr Hoar.
The Unicef call comes even as it emerged many learning institutions, especially public schools, are congested despite a requirement to observe 1.5 metres social distancing in classes.

});

Dr Hoar said schools must be safe. She asked learners, teachers and other staff to observe the social distancing whenever possible, wash hands with soap and water, ensure free circulation of air and wear clean facemasks in schools and public spaces.
  Community spread
She said research had shown that the transmission rate among children is lower than adults and asked parents to educate their children on hygiene.
“To prevent community spread of the Covid-19 to schools, parents must ensure they observe the best hygiene at home. They are also supposed to be on the forefront in ensuring children learn to observe the health protocols,” said Dr Hoar.
She added that children are safer in schools than at home and asked parents to ensure their children resume studies.
She warned that the longer children stay at home, the more they risk developing mental problems.
Dr Hoar said the Unicef is working with the State support to teachers and learners.
“With the reopening of schools, there is a lot of anxiety among parents and learners. However, we have been working with TSC to train teachers on mental health and how to handle learners when they resume school,” she said.
