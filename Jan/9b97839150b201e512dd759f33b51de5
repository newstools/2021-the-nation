1. Always be ready for any change as anything can happen 

Wanjiku Wa Gitonga in her 30s is the Inooro FM Radio Manager and a presenter who has been able to expand the radio's offering despite the pandemic 

"By the time 2020 started, I already had an annual calendar of events that were lined up. I had just completed my studies at Mt. Kenya University and I was ready to graduate.

});
}, 62000);
}




In February I organised Inooro FM's Valentines Mugithi day in Westlands and the event was extremely successful. 

Shock on me, March 2020 came and everything went haywire! Covid-19 was here with us. As time progressed, things started going out of hand especially when the president declared a lockdown. 

Reality started hitting me. 

Being in the media industry I was privy to news of the devastation. As a Christian, this hit me so hard; 'how is this possible? What will happen?' 






My event calendar was not on track. Whether I liked it or not, I had to focus on being safe as everything came to a stand-still. 

I started working from home and at the university; they organised virtual graduation which I did from the office. I only put on a gown, called my photographer to take a few photos and that was it. 

At the family level, my kids could only play indoors. 

Since life had to move on, I enrolled back to school virtually and I have gotten used to it; in fact, it is my best experience so far. 

At work, I realised there was a need to bridge the gap for our listeners. In this case, I came up with a Mugiithi Show that is hosted by our Mugiithi Queen Nyoxx Wa Katta every Friday 10 pm-3 am and also a Kesha which I host every last Saturday of the Month featuring different artists from 10 pm-5am.

});
}, 62000);
}




2020, was full of lessons and what stood out for me was to always be ready for any change. 

Anything can happen. Also, do not put all your eggs in one basket. This is because if something happens to the basket, you are left with nothing. 

2021 is here; I am hopeful that Covid-19 will be under control as I urge everyone to continue following safety rules. Considering all the plans I had for 2020 that I wanted to fulfill and the majority of them were futile, it is only safe to say I leave everything for 2021 in God's hands." 

2. I will be taking every day as it comes. Live. Enjoy. Love and laugh 

Doreen Amanga, Banker, 30, and her husband Cliff Mayaka welcomed their bundle of joy in the middle of the pandemic. Today, she is keen to take every day as it comes. 

"The 31st of December, 2019, was our first time to cross the year together as a couple after our wedding on 10th August, 2019. 

As we ushered in the New Year at midnight, I laid down my prayer requests to God. One was for God to bless us with a child in 2020. Little did I know that even in that Kesha, I was already expectant. 

Finally, the brand New Year 2020 was here. I wrote down my New Year resolutions. Nothing extraordinary, just the usual; I will manage my time and finances better, visit my friends and family more often, travel, build a deeper relationship with God, go back to school, just to mention a few. It was a year I really looked forward to.

In January, my pregnancy test turned out positive. I was overwhelmed with joy but at the same time, I was very anxious being a first-time mum. I shared the news with my husband and I could see his joy and anxiety too. 

Our highlight was just being able to see this very tiny baby growing day by day. Listening to the heartbeat brought tears to my eyes many times. 

On 5th February I started bleeding, a dangerous sign during pregnancy. I broke down and I felt hopeless as we rushed to the hospital. 

I went through tests and was informed that I was having a threatened miscarriage. Luckily, the cervix was closed and the baby had a heartbeat still. I was admitted for a few days as the doctors monitored my progress. It was a very low moment for us and the encouragement means a lot to us. 

When the Coronavirus hit, I was quite fearful and very concerned about my pregnancy. A lot was still not known about the virus and there were a lot of myths and misinformation. To make it worse, we did not know whether the virus could be transmitted to the unborn baby if the mother tested positive.

In early July, I was told I had come in contact with a colleague who had tested positive for Covid-19 and therefore had to quarantine. I had so many fears. What if I had contracted the virus as well? What would happen to me? My unborn child? I took the Covid test and it turned negative. I have never felt so relieved.

In August 2020, we were expecting our bundle of joy. I have never been so tense in my life! I had heard of all the scary stories surrounding birth and the same was made worse with the pandemic. 

The hospitals were not considered safe since they were handling Covid-19 patients. I imagined going through labour wearing masks. How would that be? I had questions about my safety and that of my baby. 

On 31st August our baby girl Neema arrived. The long journey had finally come to an end. Many people wanted to visit us even in hospital but the Covid regulations only allowed the spouse to visit. Three days later, we got discharged to start life on our own, with our little bundle in a world fighting a pandemic. 






During that season where family and friends could not visit, motherhood was quite lonely. It is only recently that we have allowed a few family and friends to visit. We have had to observe the rules and host two visitors per day. 

Through it all, I have learnt that I can make plans but God has the final say and that nothing is permanent. I take every day as it comes. Live it. Enjoy it. Love and laugh. That is what am taking with me to the year 2021." 

3. I shall survive 2021 in spite of any surprises

Elizabeth Musyoki, 30 is a nurse in the academia who volunteered her services and tested positive for Covid-19 

"2020 going to be an epic year for me. It was the year got to the third floor, the year of triple blessings, portions and three times everything. I observed the prayer and fasting season and after the fasting season, I was sure all mountains ahead of me had been leveled. I held on to the promise card I received on New Year's eve from psalms 62:6 "He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken." I mean what was going to shake me now? I was grounded and immovable or so I thought. 

Then in March, the Coronavirus reached Kenya. 

I am a nurse though I practice in academia. When colleges got closed during the lockdown, I retreated home for online classes. But it is said once a clinician, always a clinician, and haven't you heard that nursing is a calling? 

Well, I was feeling pretty called and the online classes were not keeping me busy enough. The good nurse in me volunteered to go to the front line and help my colleagues fight this pandemic. 

The virus was new, there were many speculations, but I was not going to be shaken; 2020 was my year. I was curious and thirsty for knowledge and I needed to be on the frontline to learn hands-on. From the government facility where I volunteered, I was given PPEs; N95s and hazmat suits and I thought that was enough. 



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-6");
});
}




In May, the virus had infected frontline workers, and we got tested. Lo and behold, I turned positive. My rock, my foundation, and my fortress started shaking. Surely, who sent me? I could have been seated behind a computer, teaching some adults a thing or two from the safety of my house away from the virus, but no, I had to be a nurse, I had to go and work at the front line. 






I hated myself, my profession, I loathed how I could self-distract. Thankfully, I had only tested positive but I was not symptomatic. I was in the hospital for five days and later I was allowed to self-quarantine. 

I thought this was better since Netflix would keep me company and I wouldn't have to endure the sight of my colleagues keeping their distance from me. 

Physically, I might not have been feeling sick but my mind was tortured. I had seen how people discriminated against the positive and I was afraid to share with anyone of my predicament. I needed company, fellowship with friends but none of this was possible. 

I had to settle for phone calls and when I would run out of airtime, I would walk the streets of social media and read statuses and profiles as netizens updated them. Time seemed still and everything including religion felt vaguely meaningless.

After 10 days my test turned negative. I went back to isolation. I also thought that with the shift in the economy, I would widen my income base and probably do some investment. I liquidated a few assets, got the capital I needed to start a venture that I foresaw elevating me to the next level after Covid-19. 

When it rains, it pours. I was not the only person thinking of a side hustle, even conmen needed to widen their hustle base and as you are already guessing, I got swindled hundreds of thousands, and my ship that was already sinking hit rock bottom. 

This was a dark period for me. I couldn't believe that the Lord who promises to be with me when I pass through waters, the one who promises that I will not be overwhelmed by rivers, not be burnt by fire, would allow me to go through this. I had fear and doubt in my heart. I kept to myself and sunk into a depressed state. Only my friends saved me. 

In August, I started rising again. I am taking one step at a time. I do not have big plans for 2021 because I have learned to leave my future and any plans in it to the hands of Jesus. 

Even as I am going through my season of restoration from all that I lost, I am putting all my bets on Jesus. I shall survive 2021 in spite of any surprises."

4. 2020 taught me who is and what’s really important in life 

Vionah Githinji, in her 30s, found a new love in organic farming, after getting laid off due to Coronavirus effects on business 

“When 2020 started, I was getting my marriage back on the road after a recess. It was promising and we thought we had gotten past the tough part. 

I had a nice job with a great boss and I was regaining much of what I had lost, weight included. I am a mother of two and taking care of the girls was my priority. 

My job involved traveling and meeting lots of strangers, so when Covid-19 was reported in the country, our boss thought it wise to close the business. 

We shopped and stocked up. My girls were out of school and we paid for internet meaning we never had to leave the house unless to bask in isolation. I thought I would just go back to work and everything would be okay. However, it was not to be. I was laid off. 

In June, I started selling vegetables. By now, most people were home and I could only sell to my friends and I knew I wanted to grow my own vegetables. I got a piece of land in Kikuyu and in August, I started what we now call Shamba La Vee. 

I believe it’s easier to wash off pests than wash off chemicals. That’s why all our produce is organic. We grow traditional greens like Managu and Kunde. The social distance gave me a chance to grow my business online. My clientele base has grown through Facebook and Instagram.

The little piece of land has been my safe haven. I go there to cool off and think through life. Tilling that land has helped me cool off and let out some steam.

Have I told you I gained weight while in lockdown? So yeah, tilling the farm has brought about tremendous exercise. 

Within the same season, I met with a friend who gave me a chance to host a farmer’s show on his online TV. The job was awesome and a dream come true but it did not give me as much of a challenge as the farm did. 

Day by day, I chose the farm over TV. With the farm, I could see the crops grow and flourish. I could weed and harvest a good crop. I learnt patience from a whole new dimension. 






I have learnt something new about myself; I love the feel of soil on my toes. My hands are blessed and I have reaped the fruits of my labor. When we started the farm, I had my sister with me but with time she left it for me to tend. I love that freedom. 

I also love the sanguine in me. She loves to control and crops are easy to lord over. I have watched my daughters on the farm and just like me, love the soil. We have a new thing to bond over. My husband is supportive and it has helped me get over some things that blurred my marital glasses. 

2020 was different but I am grateful. It taught me who and what’s really important in life.2021 will be all about farming. I see myself building on the farm to include more variety like cabbage, onions, and dhania.” The silence of the night could be felt by the absence of fireworks in most areas at midnight. Celebrations were low-key in some parts of the country. Drama ensued early Saturday when the Kanu chair went to Kapsisiywa for coronation as the Kalenjin kingpin. Clinical officers agree to go back to work as more discussions take place, joining doctors who were first to return to work. In the coming months, the “Ruto parties” will avail themselves of a chance to show their mettle.
