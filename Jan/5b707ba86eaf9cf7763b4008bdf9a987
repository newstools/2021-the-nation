We wish to thank the government for making life a little easier for ordinary Kenyans in 2020.We were particularly happy with the recognition of young talented engineers.  Of all the years that have gone before us, 2020 is the one that will never go to heaven. Even if 2020 goes to heaven and is denied a permit to drink milk and honey, not even lawyers will volunteer to defend it.
We saw bad things last year. For the first time, staying alive featured among the top items on the bucket list of those making New Year resolutions. If you can read this, it means you have made it.

As we wait for the government to scramble the first batch of the Covid-19 vaccine, it is our expectation that the Covid millionaires will issue a statement promising to put their conscience before their stomachs; and in the likely event they don’t, the vaccines won’t end up rotting inside go-downs as they argue on who should receive an arm or a leg and who should be content with the feathers.

We wish to thank the government for making life a little easier for ordinary Kenyans in 2020. We were particularly happy with the recognition of young talented engineers who locally assembled ventilators to help with mass production of cheap medical equipment.
Even though we are yet to receive an update on how many of the ventilators were bought to equip our hospitals, we are grateful for the government officials who took time out of their hectic schedules to take photos with the young talents and make another round of promises that will be actualised after the completion of the historic stadium in Kamariny.
We couldn’t also be happier with the Kenya Police Service for being on guard to remind us about observing Covid regulations. Even though corporal punishment was banned in schools before Jubilee was born, the police were on hand to take us back down memory lane, beating up those found outdoors past curfew hours.

We appreciate the police for keeping our military culture alive, we hope our enemies are quaking in their boots after seeing how tough our officers can be when dealing with law breakers.
As we go into 2021, our wish is to see a police service that is kinder to suffering Kenyans and more humane in their handling of suspected law breakers. We did not see them raise a finger against the Big Five politicians who broke Covid-19 guidelines like their life depended on it, even though those super-spreader events put the lives of many Kenyans in danger.
While ordinary Kenyans do not expect to be massaged while being led to safety whenever they break the law, at least the police can stop slapping unarmed civilians in front of their loved ones to prove that they are better bullies. 
There are better ways to demonstrate misguided machismo, and pointing a gun to someone’s temple isn’t one of them. If you must kill anything to prove to your bosses that you’re doing a good job, kill the urge to demand a bribe before you offer a service you are paid to give.
In 2021, Kenyans also expect government officials to reduce the amount of salt they add while enumerating the gains they have made, because health experts have warned us that too much salt is a risk factor in cardiovascular diseases.

If you intend to buy one blade of grass to carpet the new Kisumu International Stadium, for example, kindly don’t go for nine just to make the lie good.
It is our sincere hope the government will be more responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens in 2021.
We know those who drive government policy are not ordinary people, but we ask them to walk a mile in the shoes of suffering Kenyans first before coming up with government policy, because they can afford the shoes and still have loose change to buy the priceless experience.

The footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020. However they made us feel, the men and women in this list elicited different emotions in all of us.
