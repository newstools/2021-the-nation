Many learners have been forced out of school by teenage pregnancies, early marriages and child labour.More worrying is that some teenagers were involved in crime, drug abuse, sex orgies and wild parties. At last, schools have reopened. Sadly, thousands of learners have failed to show up in class. This has arisen fear of massive dropouts caused by the prolonged closure of learning institutions. 
Many of these learners have been forced out of school by teenage pregnancies, early marriages and child labour.

More worrying is that some teenagers were involved in crime, drug abuse, sex orgies and wild parties. In some regions, learners were unable to resume classes after undergoing initiation rites, with girls who underwent the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) cut being the most affected.
It is for this reason we are grateful that education officials and administrators have warned parents that stern measures would be taken against those who normally offer their school-going children for early marriages. This will be by arresting and prosecuting parents who fail to take back their own children back to school.





‘Nyumba Kumi’ committees
Action should also be taken against those individuals who are responsible for the pregnancies. We are also having some boys who have abandoned school to engage in fishing and boda-boda business so that they can make money for themselves. 
It is for these revelations that those of us in the education sector are concerned about the high dropout rate and maybe poor performance of candidates in national examinations slated for March and April 2021. 
Fortunately, this worry has made the government rope in chiefs and their assistants and members of ‘Nyumba Kumi’ to trace the learners and bring them back to school. This is taking into consideration that directors of education are in the process of mapping learners who are not in school.

This is the action we need to take.
