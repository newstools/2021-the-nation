Anthony Davis scored a game-high 27 points as the Los Angeles Lakers delivered a dominating all-around performance on Sunday with a crushing 120-102 defeat of the Houston Rockets in Texas.
The Lakers finally hit their stride in the new NBA season, running the Rockets ragged on offense and bottling up their top scorers on defense, especially three-time league scoring champion James Harden, who was held to 20 points and committed seven turnovers.

LeBron James scored 18 points as he and fellow all-star Davis had plenty of help from the bench. Talen Horton-Tucker (17 points), Montrezl Harrell (16) and Kyle Kuzma (13) all came off the bench to reach double figures for the Lakers, who are now a perfect 5-0 on the road to start the season.
The defending NBA champions scored a whopping 32 fast break points and 62 points in the paint, finally looking like the juggernaut team that many had envisioned at the start of the season. But where they really excelled Sunday was on defense, grabbing 39 defensive rebounds and forcing 13 steals.

"We've got to be a team who lead games with defense," said Davis, who returned to the lineup Sunday after sitting out with a sore groin. "Tonight we made shots, but there are going to be nights when we don't make shots and we can't control that. 
"What we can control is how we play defense. The coach came in at halftime and said our defensive effort was off the charts."

Christian Wood paced the Rockets with 23 points while Harden also had nine assists. Houston shot just 12 for 41 from behind the arc.
Elsewhere, Kawhi Leonard scored a team high 35 points and surpassed 10,000 career points as the Los Angeles Clippers rallied to edge the Chicago Bulls 130-127.
Leonard earned the bulk of his points during an explosive third quarter in which he scored 21, a career high for one quarter.
He finished with seven three-pointers in the game, including one in the third period that allowed him to reach the milestone.
"We shot the ball well tonight and we got stops at the end of the game," said Leonard, who hit 14 of 22 shots. "I never make excuses."
The Clippers scored the first basket of the game but did not lead again until the third quarter when Leonard drained his seventh basket from beyond the arc.
Asked how he has been able to stay focused long enough to reach 10,000 career points, Leonard said, "Just hard work and dedication. I spend hours in the gym. I pretty much grind it out every day, and I have my mind set on a goal."
The Clippers were able to regroup Sunday after a crushing 115-105 loss two days earlier to the Golden State Warriors, when they surrendered a 20-point lead.

The Bulls hung in there, but suffered another disappointing close loss. They lost by two points to the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and by four points to the Sacramento Kings two days earlier.
Zach LaVine scored a season-high 45 points and he made 10 three-pointers for the Bulls, who lost their third consecutive game. Garrett Temple added 18 points and Patrick Williams had 17 points. LaVine's finished just shy of his personal high of 49 points.
The Clippers outscored the Bulls 42-35 in the third quarter to go into the fourth with the game tied 94-94.
Nicolas Batum completed a four point play with 2:30 remaining in the fourth to give the Clippers the lead for good.
In the final seconds, LaVine put up an airball from three point range and then George nailed two free throws to seal the victory.
Elsewhere, Mike Conley had 22 points and Rudy Gobert grabbed 20 rebounds as the Utah Jazz slipped past the Detroit Pistons 96-86.

Miami did not have the required number of available players to play the game while the Celtics were down to the NBA minimum of eight.
Also, Nikola Jokic posted another double-double by finishing with 22 points and 10 rebounds for the visiting Denver Nuggets, who cruised to a 114-89 win over the New York Knicks.
