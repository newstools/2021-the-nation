"Some people think we haven't played anybody," Harris said. "For us, we wanted to go against the champs. We wanted to see where we're at."
Joel Embiid scored 28 points, Ben Simmons notched a triple-double of 17 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists and Harris, fed by Seth Curry, sealed the victory with a pull-up jump shot with three seconds remaining.
The Lakers, who had won a franchise-best 10 road games to start the season, nearly kept the streak alive despite trailing by 14 points in the fourth quarter.

James was assessed a flagrant foul and Embiid, who missed the 76ers' previous game with back tightness, gingerly tested himself after he rose but stayed in the game.
"That's a very dangerous play," Embiid said. "I guarantee if that was me I would have probably been ejected from the game."
