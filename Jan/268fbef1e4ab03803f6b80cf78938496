Speaking during his unveiling at the KPA Mbaraki Sports Club, Mbungo who was being courted by other top local league sides, said he has been a longtime admirer of Bandari Football Club, which he said is run professionally and has a project of youth development, which has been his main area of emphasis in whichever team he chooses to work with.
“I'm happy to be at Bandari Football Club, a team I have liked all along since I set my foot in Kenya as AFC Leopards coach in 2019. I have played a couple of matches against them and I must confess I liked the professionalism with which they handled their players and discipline within the playing unit," Mbungo said at the function which was also attended by Bandari Football Club vice chairman Bernard Osero, Chief Executive Officer Edward Oduor, Organising Secretary Dickson Kibagendi and board treasurer Mohamed Nazzir Tostao.
