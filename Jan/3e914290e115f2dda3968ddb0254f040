Iran has, by and large, showed diplomatic restraint or “strategic patience” but internal pressure is mounting on Tehran to avenge the alleged foreign sabotage operations. The reasoning for the “external aggression” is the Persian country being seen as a security threat to Israel. 
With the backing of outgoing US President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lately started to form a seemingly widening alliance against Iran under the so-called peace deals with neighbouring Mideast states, such as Bahrain and Qatar, at the expense of the long-standing Palestinian question.

Security threat
Instructively, historian and former Israel Defence Force (IDF) soldier, Prof Avi Shlaim, has previously pointed out that Iran may be a strategic threat to Israel but not an existential security threat as presented in the global political arena.
Two years ago, Prof Shlaim told Aljazeera’s Head to Head programme, in which former Israel’s deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon appeared, that, unlike the Jewish state, Iran has never attacked a neighbour, has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, submits to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and has no nuclear weapons yet Israel has a stockpile of 75 to 400 of them.

Incoming US President Joe Biden should defuse the tension by reverting to dialogue and the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, signed in Vienna on July 14, 2015.
