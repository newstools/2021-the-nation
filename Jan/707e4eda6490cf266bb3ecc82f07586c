"We are a totally different team when those guys are out here," guard LeVert said, "but I think we've done a great job of having a next-man-up mentality, guys stepping into those roles and fulfilling what we need as a team.:
Durant sat out due to Covid-19 protocols and Irving missed the game due to "personal reasons".
Nets coach Steve Nash said before the contest that Irving's absence came as a surprise to him and he remained unsure of the exact issue.
"I sent him a message in the last half-hour and haven't heard back yet," Nash said. "But obviously thinking about him and hope that all is well. It's a private matter."

Got the job done
Nash did say that Durant, who had to quarantine after possible Covid-19 exposure, could return on Sunday.
In the meantime, Harris got the job done, finishing two points shy of his career high as the Nets posted their second straight double-digit win after dropping four of five. 
LeVert, who started in place of Irving, made the most of his opportunity. He scored 18 points by halftime as the Nets shot 45.4 percent and scored 35 points off 20 Philadelphia turnovers. 
"When we play connected and we have that fighting spirit, we give ourselves a great chance every night no matter who's available," Nash said.
