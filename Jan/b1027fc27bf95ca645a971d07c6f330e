Gor has had mixed fortunes in the Confederation Cup in the past three seasons.
In 2018, Gor reached the group stages but failed to qualify for the quarter-finals stage after finishing third in a group that had Rayon Sports of Rwanda, Young Africans (Tanzania) and USM Algiers of Algeria. The Algerians topped the group while Rayon Sports finished as runner-up.
In 2019, Gor went a notch higher qualifying for the last eight after finishing  second in a tough group which comprised of  leaders Zamalek of Egypt, Petro de Luanda of Angola and NA Hussein Dey from Algeria.
Gor Mahia set a date with the defending champions RS Berkane of Morocco in the quarters where they lost 2-0 at home before being thrashed 5-1 in Morocco to bow out 7-1 on aggregate.
