In a world where social media is increasingly evolving into a basic need for the youth, social influence is equally accelerating, leaving a section of this age-set drowning in a pool of instant gratification.
This trend is cultivating a culture of peer pressure among the youth, subjecting them to socio-economic stress, which threatens their mental health as well as their economic future.
Alive to the fact that about 75 per cent of Kenya’s population is below 35 years, practising delayed gratification by trusting the process will save the day and place the youth at a vantage position to live a better life in future.

For instance, one can forgo buying an expensive trendy item if they cannot afford it and decide to buy more affordable option/s without a struggle. This is the virtue that remains critical for today’s youth to balance their financial knowledge for better lives. In many ways, it is the secret to living a better life.
For instance, as of December 2020, data from the Federation of Kenya Employers indicated that about 600 firms in Kenya laid off staff due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics Quarterly Labour Force Survey indicated that the rate of unemployment stood at 10.4 per cent as of September 2020.

Avoid peer pressure
This shows that jobs uncertainty is still a major problem and there is a need for individuals to build resilience and make better personal choices. One of the ways to do this is resisting social media influence and asking critical questions before embarking on anything. The question of “is this a need or a want?” should always be answered before making any purchase decision.
With information from DataReportal Global Report of July 2020 indicating that the average amount of time each day that internet users aged 16 to 64 spend on social media is two hours and 22 minutes, there is a big chance that one will encounter posts of friends and strangers displaying their achievements. Rarely will you see posts about their struggles, which sends a strong message.
Success stories
The need to impress other people should never be a pressing item for anyone. Normalising ordinary life with plans of a better future should be paramount for the youth. Despite the success stories we all hear from celebrities, youth should avoid material pressure and understand the struggles that these celebrities went through to attain their goals. 
The worry about a better financial future will always be terrifying at some point, but balancing between the current spending on what is necessary and setting a future savings base on which one can attain a bigger goal in life is key in bettering oneself.

By avoiding peer pressure, trusting the process and setting your goals, patience will ultimately lead you to success. With that, the youth shall be in a position to build a future that is promising not only to them, but also to future generations.
