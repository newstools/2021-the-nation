Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said the universal connectivity plan still remains on course as a matter of policy which is also provided for in the Energy Act 2019.Treasury, however, recently moved to re-introduce taxation on solar products used in setting up of the mini-grids, essentially throwing the plan in limbo. Ideally, every Kenyan household should have been connected to the national electricity grid by the end of next year, according to State ambitions. 

But this remains on paper as the country is set to miss its 2022 target leaving at least some two million households in the dark. 

With that, one of Jubilee administration’s key election pledges will have fallen apart and the ripple effects will not spare President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy under the Big Four Agenda of affordable housing, manufacturing, food security and universal healthcare.

Achievement of the country’s development goals under Vision 2030 of becoming a newly industrialised and middle-income nation may also experience a major setback since competitively-priced, reliable, safe and sustainable energy is a key driver to the achievement of the ambition. 






The Ministry of Energy now says the target is likely to be missed by about 15 percent owing to several factors among them slower rate of connectivity last year and increased taxation on solar products that may affect their use in far-flung rural areas. 

The estimate may, however, be conservative given that more households continue to emerge and there is an imminent slowdown in projects due to economic slowdown from Covid-19 and the charging political climate ahead of the 2022 elections. 

Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said the universal connectivity plan still remains on course as a matter of policy which is also provided for in the Energy Act 2019. 

Three million 

“We have done quite well over the period where we have pushed the number of connections to 7.8 million from below three million in 2013. We are likely to hit 85 percent by 2022 after we are done with the off-grid connection plan in the arid and semi-arid areas funded by the World Bank,” Mr Keter said.

The government through the Kenya National Electrification Strategy released in 2018 had aimed at connecting more than five million households to the main grid under a Sh270 billion plan that would see all households hooked to the electricity by 2022. 

The universal hook-up plan would be implemented in partnership with funding agencies such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank. 

It was the final leg in the increased electricity connection that had seen about 70 percent of households connected to the main grid. Data from Kenya Power shows connectivity growth rate has been slowing down over the years from a peak of 35.4 percent in 2015 when the government launched the Last Mile Connectivity Project to last year’s 4.5 percent when only 306,771 new customers were connected. 

Data submitted to the National Treasury by the Energy ministry shows that Kenya Power connected 1.2 million customers less in the three years to June 2020 due to a ‘reduced capital expenditure on the infrastructure development due KPLC Budget rationalisation.’

Under the subsidised plan that would see customers in the rural areas pay Sh15,000 spread over their electricity bills gradually over time as they consume the power, every household was expected to be hooked to the electricity mains by 2022.

The ministry had targeted giving priority to households located up to 15 kilometres within the existing Kenya Power lines in what is expected to yield 269,000 connections. Additional transformers in new areas would connect 2.7 million customers located between 600 metres and two kilometres around transformers. 

New transformers 

This may, however, not be possible since over the three-year period, Kenya Power fell short on the number of new transformers installed by 1,117, blaming the shortfall on non-availability of wooden poles. 

“Underachievement was due to budget cuts, delays in processing tax exemptions and clearance of materials at the port, government ban on logging, litigations, Covid 19 containment measures among others,” the ministry wrote regarding the missed target on the number of customers connected between June 2017 and June 2020. 

The explanations touching on the ban on logging, taxation and delayed clearance of materials at the port seemed to point inwards at the same government which may have shot itself in the foot in stifling one of Jubilee’s key pledges and legacy projects. 

In the same manner, the government had projected to take advantage of having some 121 mini grids facilitated to connect 35,000 customers to meet the ambitious target in remote areas.

Treasury, however, recently moved to re-introduce taxation on solar products used in setting up of the mini-grids, essentially throwing the plan in limbo. 

The country is also relying on solar to largely implement its Kenya Off-Grid Solar Access Project (KOSAP) financed by the World Bank, aimed at providing electricity to parts of the country that are not served by the national grid. 

Under the Sh15 billion project, counties of West Pokot, Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Garrisa, Tana River, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta and Narok are expected to be connected to the electricity mains which the country considers a critical factor in fighting poverty.

Universal power connectivity would have been president Kenyatta’s key legacy achievement much as Kenya still ranks higher than its peers and neighbouring countries on the level of power connectivity among its population. 

By 2018, the country’s 73.4 percent access rate was ranked highest in East Africa according to the World Bank’s Energy Progress Report, which attributed the growth to the various national electrification projects that have been undertaken by Kenya Power such as the Last Mile Connectivity Project and GPOBA that targets informal settlements in urban areas and low-income households in the rural areas.
