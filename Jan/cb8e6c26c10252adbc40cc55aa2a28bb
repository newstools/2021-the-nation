The 65-year-old intends to vie for president in the 2022 General Election.
He has joined several other leaders, including Deputy President William Ruto and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, in the race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Dr Kituyi was a powerful minister during President Mwai Kibaki’s regime.
He says he is ready to contest against the political bigwigs and that he can ably serve Kenyans owing to his international experience.





He has already started touring the country for meetings with key people as he plans to form a team to work on his bid. The outgoing Unctad secretary-general says he can ably serve Kenyans owing to his international experience. He is the seventh UNCTAD secretary general. Mr Museveni leads with 4,340,134 million votes against NUP presidential candidate, Bobi Wine’s 2,164,347 votes. Earlier on Friday, the Ugandan opposition leader said the election had seen "widespread fraud and violence". Ugandan opposition leader rejects early results which gave President Yoweri Museveni a wide lead as a "joke".
