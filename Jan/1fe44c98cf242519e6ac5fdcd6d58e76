“Our elections were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic but we are determined  to hold them in the next few weeks so that those elected into office can start organising basketball activities immediately since we are already behind schedule,” Kisoi, who will be hoping to succeed  Vitalis Gode as the new KBF secretary general, said.
Gode, who has served as a top KBF official for two decades, has already indicated he will not be defending his seat at the federation opting to concentrate on his role as Fiba referees supervisor.
