Kiprop would chest the finishing tape in 29 minutes and 44.2 seconds, beating Elphas Cheboi from Elgeyo Marakwet and Iten’s Weldon Kipkirui, who finished second and third in 29:47.5 and 29:50.3 respectively.
“It was a beautiful race and after some exchange, I decided to take off with two laps to test Cheboi and Kipkurui and it worked...I looked stronger,” said Kiprop, who was competing for the first time since the Kip Keino Classic on October 3 last year where he failed to finish the 5,000m race owing to a calf injury.





Kiprop now turns his focus to the upcoming regional cross country and national cross country championships before the track season. “I want to see if I will make it to the three major events this year,” said Kiprop.
Kiprop singled out the Africa Cross Country Championships slated for March 6 in Lome, Togo, Africa Senior Championships planned for June 1-5 in Algiers and the Tokyo Olympic Games from July 23 to August 8.
Chirchir tore the course at the People’s Park and the field in 33:33.4 to leave another Elgeyo Marakwet athlete Caroline Chepkoech battling for second place in 33:37.5 with youngster Edinah Jebitok from Kapkaimur coming in third in 33:45.4.
Ol Kalou’s event was the last in Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series that started in Machakos on November 28 and Mosoriot, Nandi County on December 19.
