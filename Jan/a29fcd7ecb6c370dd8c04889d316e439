A matatu conductor treated a Nairobi court to a light moment when confessed that Blue Ice beer and smoking bhang gravitated him towards older women.
Wyclife Alloys Orinda, 27, made the confession before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku during the hearing of a case where he is accused of creating a disturbance in the Nairobi city centre.

"I was high when l approached my 45-year-old wife with whom we have two beautiful children," he said as he urged the magistrate to free him so he can return to work between Westlands and Kibera.
"l am never violent. When l down Blue Ice and a puff of bhang l become very high and sexy. I see older women as if they are young women my age. I make them happy and they feel very nice in my hands," he told the court, much to the amusement of all those present.

He further urged the magistrate to direct his wife, Carolyne Wangui Kinyanjui, to allow him see his children aged 3 years and 9 months.





"I want to see my children and play with them," Mr Orinda said.
He admitted that on January 11 at Revlon Plaza along Biashara Street, he created disturbance by insulting and threatening Mary Nyaguthi and pulling down a banner at her shop.
The State prosecutor said Mr Orinda brought business at the bazaar to a standstill.
But in his defence, Mr Orinda said he behaved that way because his wife had taken off with his children.
"Last year Wangui and Nyaguthii accused me of creating disturbance and I was jailed. I served sentence at Industrial Area Prison remand. When I was free l did not find them at Eastleigh where we were residing. They had moved to Mwimuto," he told the court.

But asked if the court can trust him with the children when he is a drunkard, he replied: "I love my children and old wife. I canâ€™t hurt them."
Ms Mutuku called for a probation report for the accused to establish his character. He will remanded until January 28, 2021 when he will know his fate.
