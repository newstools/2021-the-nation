According to NOC-K President Paul Tergat and Kenya Charity Sweepstakes Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Yaron Farachi, the funds will be used in preparing athletes for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics in Japan, and other events beyond, including the 2024 Olympics in Paris, France.
Kenya Charity Sweepstakes, a lottery company that has been in the local market for more than 50 years has now kick-started that partnership by donating Sh10 million to NOC-K.





“Because of this sponsorship, I believe we will have good training, and when we participate in the Olympics, we will make a change. We have not featured in the Olympics for 14 years and therefore we believe it is our time. We will definitely do well,” said Moim during the event held in Nairobi.

Kenya Lioness captain Philadelphia Olando said: “As athletes we believe we are on the right track, as far as Olympics is concerned and this support will go a long way in ensuring that we perform well in the games.”
NOC-K president Tergat commended the lottery and charity organisation for choosing to work with them, promising that the funds will be used prudently.
“The partnership we have had with them (Kenya Charity Sweepstakes) is a long one and for them to come in now, it shows the importance that they are putting towards the development of sports in this country and we appreciate it. Our objective is and remains to ensure that all the resources that our partners are giving us will always go into the promotion of sportsmen and the Olympics movement. That is the spirit that we have,” he said.
