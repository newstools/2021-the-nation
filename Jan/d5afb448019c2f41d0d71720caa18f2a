In Nairobi, the fireworks display that happens at the start of New Year every year at KICC took place hours before midnight.In Mombasa, fireworks at Fort Jesus and the English Point Marina went off at around 9.30pm. Kenyans welcomed the new year under strange circumstances on Thursday night as silence reigned in places that have had cheer in previous years.
Church prayers ended early and some Kenyans in border counties crossed to Tanzania to have a semblance of a mass celebration. For those who craved a celebratory entry to 2021, it was a night of hide-and-seek with police across various towns, with some revellers hiding behind closed doors to party.

In the border counties of Kwale and Taita-Taveta, hundreds of Kenyans crossed to Tanzania, where there are less restrictive Covid-19 mitigation measures.
Some spent the whole night there before returning post-curfew. The fact that the Kenyan shilling is stronger than Tanzania’s was also a reason for the Kenyans to switch territories for the night.
“We have a strong currency compared to Tanzania and we can afford to buy what we want. We cannot stay in the house as we cross to the new year,” said Mr John Mwalekwa.





The silence of the night, which was further dampened by torrents of rain that fell in various towns, could be felt by the absence of fireworks in most areas at midnight.
For example in Nakuru Town, the usual New Year fireworks were absent. Kenyatta Avenue, which usually hosts celebrants, was deserted and only police officers patrolled the streets.
In Nairobi, the fireworks display that happens at the start of New Year every year at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre took place hours before midnight. And in Mombasa, fireworks at Fort Jesus and the English Point Marina went off at around 9.30pm.

Thanksgiving prayers
Those who abided by the government health advisories held hurried celebrations to ensure everything was done by 10pm. A number of churches, for instance, finalised prayers by 8pm in various parts across the country.

At the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral in Eldoret, only few believers attended the thanksgiving prayers presided over by Bishop Dominic Kimeng’ich. Kilometres away in the Nyanza region, Rongo Central SDA and Namome SDA in Suna East had their evening services run from 6pm to 8pm.
Followers of Prophet David Owuor’s Repentance and Holiness Kings Outreach Church streamed into the Nakuru-based church from as early as 5pm. 
Some churches opted for virtual services, including Bible Way Ministries in Mombasa ,whose bishop Tom Arati held an online sermon on how to conquer one’s fears.
Equally, at the Voice of Salvation and Healing Church in Kisumu, it was only the archbishop, reverend and praise and worship teams plus a handful of faithful who were present in church as the rest followed the proceedings online.
But even as a majority of Kenyans quietly crossed over to 2021 in their homes, some could not resist the temptation to make merry.
There was also a spirit of defiance against Covid-19 control measures at some areas in Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, Murang’a, Thika and Migori, where people partied the night away despite warnings about the risk posed by congregating.

As a result of disobeying the curfew, tens were arrested in Nakuru by an operation led by Nakuru Town East Sub-county police commander Ellena Kabukuru.

In Kisumu, County Commander Ranson Lolmodooni said police had arrested many people who were found drinking past curfew hours, adding that those arrested were released on bond and are set to be charged in court on Monday.
Running battles
In Migori, more than 20 people were arrested during running battles with police. They ventured out despite a stern warning by county commissioner Boaz Cherutich. Most bars in Migori were packed to the brim and had parties running through the night.
Revellers threw caution to the wind at midnight, pouring to the streets while cheering and ululating as they ran around the street. Police had to swing into action to restore calm.
There was a similar spirit of defiance in Murang’a County, where by 10pm, scores of revellers were still outdoors.
A police officer said it would be a tough night for patrols in the town because bars owned by prominent people have been among the most notorious in breaking the Covid-19 protocols.
Internationally, places that have traditionally seen large crowds at the turn of the year were also deserted, like the Times Square in New York that was mute for the first time in ages.
AFP reported that even the famed Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was nearly empty this time as people kept away due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

And in England, what would have been a night to celebrate the start of severed ties with the European Union was an eerily quiet night. At Downing Street, where the Prime Minister traditionally bongs a gong to start a party, all was silent.

In his new year’s message to the country, the President called for a renewal of minds in the New Year 2021. Drama ensued early Saturday when the Kanu chair went to Kapsisiywa for coronation as the Kalenjin kingpin. Clinical officers agree to go back to work as more discussions take place, joining doctors who were first to return to work. In the coming months, the “Ruto parties” will avail themselves of a chance to show their mettle.
