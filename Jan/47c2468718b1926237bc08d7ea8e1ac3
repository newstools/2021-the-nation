The CS also noted that the completion will enable the county to showcase the state-of-the-art stadium, which is expected to be the conference venue for the upcoming Africities summit in November this year.

Africities is the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa's flagship Pan-African event that is held every three years in one of the five regions of Africa.
“Kisumu will become the first intermediary city to host the Africities , which is expected to be attended by more tha 10,000 delegates during the ninth edition of Africities,”  said the CS.
