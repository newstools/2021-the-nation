Kandie and Kiptanui are on the list of 60 elite athletes who will fight for the Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates.
“It is very possible to break my own world record in 21 kilometres,” Kandie, who led from gun to tape, said.
Kandie also revealed he has trained his sights on taking the national cross country crown next month at Ngong Racecourse where he is expected to face stiff competition.
Kandie is eyeing a ticket for 2020 Africa Cross Country championships in Togo in March with his biggest goal this year being the Tokyo 2020 Games in Japan in July/August.





“I target a gold medal in Tokyo Olympics,” Kandie promised the Defense Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma, who attended the KDF Cross Country Championships. Obiri failed to defend her title last year owing to an injury. Chelangat led from gun to tape to win in 33 minutes and 34.5 seconds. They are the new chair and vice chair succeeding Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), respectively. Jubilee party official says BBI was sold in Mount Kenya by force “and Murang'a Senator did nothing bad to highlight these issues to the President.” Minister says new time zone is based on South Sudan’s location on the globe.
