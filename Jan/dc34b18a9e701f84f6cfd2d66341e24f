Bandari, who were missing the services of their dependable attacker William Wadri due to suspension, sent an early warning to Mathare by forcing two corner-kicks and free-kick in the first 10minutes of the exchange.
Bandari's Danson Namasaka then tested goalkeeper Job Ochieng with a long drive in the 12th minute, before the "Slum Boys" responded to the Dockers' attacks two minutes later through John Mwangi's effort.
Daniel Otieno impressed in the 34th minute, when he dribbled well from the right flank into Bandari's box but instead of pulling a shot to complete the beautiful move, he opted for a cross, which Benard Odhiambo cleared.
