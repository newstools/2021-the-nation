The  Holy See Press Office announced this on Monday, saying Pope Francis had accepted his resignation, tendered after Cardinal Njue attained the mandatory retirement age of 75 years.
Cardinal Njue was born in Kiriari, Embu, in 1944 and is 77 years old.

According to the Vatican, he was ordained a priest by Pope Paul VI on 6 January 1973. 
The cardinal was appointed Archbishop of Nairobi on October 6, 2007, taking over from Archbishop Ndingi Mwana a’Nzeki, who retired in October 2007 turning 75.
The pope appointed Right Reverend David Kamau, the Auxiliary Bishop of Nairobi, as the Apostolic Administrator of the Nairobi diocese.
According to the Canon Law, archdiocesan or diocesan bishops including cardinals, are requested to submit their resignation to the Pope on reaching age 75.





The laws state, however, that cardinals are eligible to vote for a new Pope until they turn 80 and can also take part in crucial decisions when called upon by the Pope.
