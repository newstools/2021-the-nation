The Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) is set to refurbish the iconic City Square Post Office footbridge along the busy Haile Selassie Avenue even as plans to construct a new one remain in the pipeline.
This is after the footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020.

Part of the upgrade will see NMS erect a temporary steel structure to support the bridge as plans to construct a new one get underway.
In the meantime, pedestrians and motorists have been advised to exercise caution.

Temporary structure 
NMS Director of Roads, Infrastructure and Public Works Engineer Michael Ochieng said the temporary structure will be erected to support the footbridge in the short term as plans for the construction of a new footbridge are finalised.
He pointed out that zebra crossing signs have already been placed along the road for pedestrians' use, a situation that will temporarily slow down traffic flow along the busy avenue.

"The footbridge is quite significant for pedestrians crossing the Haile Selassie Avenue from Kenya Railways headquarters and its damage had to be addressed immediately," said Mr Ochieng.
The director asked pedestrians and motorists using the road to exercise caution, especially at the construction site to avoid accidents. Establishment of the Nairobi Metropolitan Services left governor with the control of less influential county departments. Feeling cornered after being charged with the theft of Sh357 million, Governor Mike Sonko went on the rampage. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years. However they made us feel, the men and women in this list elicited different emotions in all of us.
