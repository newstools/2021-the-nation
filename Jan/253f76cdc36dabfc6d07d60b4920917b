Global warming has changed food production patterns. Poverty still runs deep in Africa, with a third of the continent’s population still trapped in extreme penury. Kenya’s two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council officially kicked off with the installation of the country’s flag at the UN headquarters on Monday January 4, 2020.
The ceremony also unfolded during Kenya’s final year as a member of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union. Kenya is joining four other new entrants to the most powerful UN organ at a time of heightened vulnerabilities to peace and security around the world, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Nairobi now embodies the aspirations of not just African countries but also the larger global South; whose socioeconomic transformation prospects have been held back by conflict and intractable fragilities.
In Africa, many countries have been infiltrated by armed groups whose activities threaten lives and property. The threat of terrorism is another reality that many countries around the world, including Kenya, have to contend with.

Beyond these national security concerns, there is a growing toll on human security in which climate change, global inequality and lately, pandemics are some of the key instigators.
Poverty
Global warming has changed food production patterns for millions of people. Poverty still runs deep in Africa, with a third of the continent’s population still trapped in extreme penury. The Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the economic situation for many people across the world – making economic recovery and reconstruction a key anchor of global wellness.
These two strands of conflict have persisted around the world despite efforts multilateral efforts to stem them.
New approaches to conflict resolution and peace fortification must now be part of the broader engagements by concerned parties.

The new proposals by President Uhuru Kenyatta on how to engender peace across the continent anchor hope for a better tomorrow for many communities currently under the throes of conflict.
The tendency to broker ideas on peace and security without giving due consideration to the voices of the parties to the conflict has not had positive results.
Such approaches have tended to address superficial manifestations of the conflict instead of the root causes. The United Nations Security Council must move beyond peace keeping and encourage true dialogue among the conflicting parties for sustainable and peaceful coexistence.
During its tenure at UNSC as well as Peace and Security Council of the African Union, Kenya should push for local ownership of the processes, proposals and mechanisms of resolving the long festering and emerging conflicts in Africa and beyond.
Secondly, Nairobi must join the voices calling for timely, equitable and adequate access to the Covid-19 vaccines. The pandemic has caused economic and health havoc upon the lives of many across the continent and beyond.
Erosion of productive sectors in the backdrop of the pandemic is pushing back millions through the poverty pores. Vaccines present the much awaited opportunity to reset the lost jobs and getting economies working again.

The alternative is widespread hopelessness among the youth, making them amenable to conflict, crime and violent extremism.
Given the trans-boundary nature of the most debilitating challenges facing humanity today, it is only prudent that Kenya has identified multilateralism and global cooperation as the most effective vehicle to confront the challenges.
Countries, big and small, should commit to pool together ideas and resources while pulling in the same direction.
In a region fraught with conflicts, Nairobi has cut itself a profile of a peaceful country anchored on rule of law and democracy. Kenya has equally been active in negotiating peaceful resolutions of a number of conflicts in the continent while remaining an influential political actor in the region and continent.
The UNSC seat is another opportunity for Kenya to share its resourcefulness in creating a safer, peaceful and more prosperous world.
