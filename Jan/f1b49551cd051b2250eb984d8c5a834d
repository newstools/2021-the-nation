The trial of a man accused of throwing a tear gas canister at a rally in Wajir attended by more than 30 women MPs in 2019 resumes next month.
But before the trial of Ali Yasin Mohamed resumes, lawyers watching his brief want the court to ensure persons named in the trial record statements.
Prosecution Counsel Samson Ngetich had in a letter to the police dated December 8, 2020 asked for the arrest of Mr Ahmed Mohamed alias Stoneman and directed the officers to record a statement from Weli Gedi, within 14 days.

The prosecutor indicated that a witness identified as Osman Abdile had indicated in his statement that he works for Sahan Tours and Travel, an organization based in Wajir, indicated that Mr Weli made travel arrangements for the youth. 
In a letter to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Lumallas Achieng & Kavere Advocates also wants the police to investigate complaints of intimidation of locals in Wajir.





The law firm also wants the arrest of Mr Mohamed, saying a warrant for his arrest was issued in February last year but nothing has happened since then.
Mr Yasin was charged in December 2019 with committing a terrorist act among other counts. Eight witnesses have testified in the case with most of the witnesses implicating Weli, alleged to be a brother to the MP of ferrying the youth from Kibera to disrupt the rally. The court was told that five youths were ferried from Kibera in Nairobi.
Mr Yasin is alleged to have committed the offence on November 29, 2019, during a rally at Qorahay grounds, where women MPs under Inua Mama, were to distribute gas cylinders, mattresses and wheelchairs to disabled. He was arrested as he attempted to get away.
Several people sustained minor injuries after the teargas canister went off near the dais at Qorahay grounds.

The law firm also asked the police to summon Wajir woman representative Fatuma Gedi and her brother as witnesses and shed light on the matter. “To clear her name, your office must undertake its part without fear and without favor. The freedom and liberty of one accused person is at stake,” the letter states.
