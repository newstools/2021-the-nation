Price of wheat 
Mr Bimal Shah, managing director of Broadway Group of Companies, said the cost of bread was raised on January 5 after the price of wheat went up significantly globally from where Kenya procures up to 75 per cent of her total requirement.
The price of a tonne of wheat has increased by 30 per cent to Sh33,000 from Sh25,300, sparking a rally both on bakers and standard flour.





“Since last year, we’ve witnessed a significant increase in cost of wheat and this, coupled with high cost of other ingredients that we use, has necessitated the price increase on bread,” Mr Shah said.
The price of bakers flour has increased from Sh2,500 to Sh2,900 because of expensive wheat. Low demand by millers and consumers going for posho mills sees firms cut cost. Retailers have raised the cost for several basic household commodities after similar increases by suppliers.
