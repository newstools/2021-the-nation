This wealth of information, ideas and stock of experiences can be used strategically. The total sum of such experiences is too valuable for it to be left untapped. Occasionally, the media may grant such people some airtime to articulate some issues which lacks a mechanism for effective utilisation.
There is need to tap into such experiences by establishing officially recognised think-tanks, also called Public Policy Research, Analysis and Engagement Organisations.

Through such forums, citizens can exchange ideas and knowledge, thereby addressing gaps in the much needed civic education and engagement.
Such think-tanks should be able to challenge the existing information, procedures and practices of government bureaucrats and elected leaders and promote the concept of business unusual.
