The North East region qualifiers was initially programmed for January 18-24, but Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) last year asked the African body to consider postponing the event due to time constraints.
The development was occasioned after the Sports Ministry gave the Union the green-light to resume activities including national teams assignments and Premier League matches.
A statement sent to National Federations read,"Throughout 2020, the AfHF has been engaged in many online meetings with the international Hockey Federation (FIH) and other continental Federations to brainstorm ideas and coordinate efforts to formulate the way forward amidst such unprecedented of uncertainty.





"In addition, several online Executive Board meetings took place resulting in the following resolutions. Due to Covid-19 related restrictions in Kenya not making it possible for the competition to take place during January 2021 as scheduled this tournament has been postponed to the period of March 1-7."
