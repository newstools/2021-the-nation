Police suspect the five -  a father, mother and their three children - died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

“We believe he overslept and forgot to put out the fire. The family may have died of suffocation after inhaling carbon monoxide,” Mr Lingera said, adding an investigation will confirm the cause of death.
The OCPD noted that foul play is not suspected because there were no physical body injuries or signs of a struggle. He also said police officers found the maize boiling.
Police sources said they were alerted by neighbours who became worried as the man did not start working at the expected time.
