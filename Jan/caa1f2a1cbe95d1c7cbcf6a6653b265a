All through 2020, Dadaab refugees have seen little effort at developing durable solutions.Refugees in Dadaab need access to opportunities and the possibility to choose how they want to live.  I first met Bahati Ernestine, 26, in Nairobi late 2019, when in-person events were still the norm. Her story offered a rare light in what was yet another jargon-studded conference to seek solutions for hundreds of thousands of refugees stuck in remote camps in Kenya.
Among the world’s mere three per cent refugees to have completed university education, Bahati had surmounted immeasurable odds to earn a nursing degree.

Escaping genocide in Rwanda, in 1994, Bahati’s family had first fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, from where they eventually made their way to Kenya. On arriving in Kenya, her parents decided against settling in a refugee camp, opting instead to make a living on the outskirts of Nairobi.
That decision proved life-changing for Bahati, opening access to education opportunities she may not have had in a camp. She had the courage and determination to persevere, snapping up whatever meagre opportunity that presented itself — from a scholarship programme to an internship at the renowned Kenyatta National Hospital.





Along the way, she faced challenges — that those without a country to call home often do: convincing the bureaucracy that you exist, fighting to be more than a refugee. No birth certificate and limited rights meant this remained a constant struggle.
I’ve spent the last two years closely following the waning hopes of Dadaab refugees; their three-decade ordeal for human dignity remains elusive, locked up as they are in remote camps.
Therefore, stumbling upon Bahati provided hope and inspiration. Yet Bahati’s personal struggle and resilience — formidable given the odds stacked against her — was made possible by choice and opportunities, however limited.

Catastrophic policy choice
But the over two-hundred thousand refugees in Dadaab, consigned to a barren prison, have never had much choice — except to go back to the country they fled from. For a majority, that happens to be Somalia, where skills needed to evade threat to life are as elemental as skills required to not go hungry.
It all stems from a catastrophic policy choice: to keep refugees in camps, where they remain dependent on measly and ever-dwindling humanitarian assistance, with virtually no access to jobs, higher education or specialised healthcare.
Lifesaving to start with, when their existence stretches for decades, camps become terribly inhumane, testing human resilience, grinding hopes and crushing talent of people, who could otherwise contribute so much to society.
It was this realisation, two years ago, that prompted States to agree to a Global Compact on Refugees (GCR). The compact conceived assisting refugees as a global public responsibility, requiring increased support for hosting countries to ensure they could provide refugees access to public services and assimilate them in their social fabric. Many rich countries also recognised the need for additional efforts to provide resettlement options for refugees.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The compact’s promise reverberated in Kenya and the wider region. Local counties such as Garissa — which hosts Dadaab — started working on including refugees in their development plans, most likely seeing an opportunity to attract more funding to develop the region.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



And at the first-ever Global Refugee Forum 2019, the countries in the region under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development pledged to establish a ‘Support Platform’, which could mobilise funding to help host countries such as Kenya implement the commitments they have taken when subscribing to the GCR.
The Covid-19 pandemic has slashed that progress. All through 2020, Dadaab refugees have seen little effort at developing durable solutions respecting their dignity and legitimate aspiration to have a life, rather than just survive and resettlement options have all but waned, with UNHCR announcing 2020 to be a record low for resettlement.
So, the ‘city of thorns’ remains, where lives continue to be on hold, and dreams die a slow death.
Critical challenge
The withering hopes of successive generations is taking a severe psychological toll on many. As we warned, a mental health crisis is growing in Dadaab. Already this year, at least 13 people have attempted suicide in Dagahaley camp, two with fatal outcomes.

});
}



Dadaab also presents a critical challenge for organisations like mine. For how long do we continue to support a camp that saves lives but robs human dignity? We’ve been providing medical services for most of the camp’s three-decade existence. By doing so, are we perpetuating a soul-crushing system?
As a humanitarian organisation with limited means, we’re doing our little by providing a small number of scholarships for refugee adults to study nursing and other paramedical professions.
Once they graduate, they will become part of a vital health force, sorely needed to address public health challenges in countries like Kenya. 
But as Bahati knows only too well, education is just one among a series of hurdles refugees must overcome. Securing a work permit requires navigating a labyrinthine bureaucracy.
Bahati is determined to persevere. She told me she will push the system to get to practise nursing. In Swahili, ‘Bahati’ means luck. So, with some luck on her side, she may well succeed.

});
}, 62000);
}



But refugees in Dadaab will need much more than luck to turn their fortunes around. They need access to opportunities — mostly education and livelihoods — and the possibility to choose how they want to live. Humanitarian aid has been vital in sustaining Dadaab refugees; it can still support them to transition to a life of dignity.
