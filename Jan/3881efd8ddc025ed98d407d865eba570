Aluoch said it’s their intention to have the team proceed to camp from Monday next week, since they want more para-athletes to qualify for Tokyo."Having them in camp will ensure that they stay away from many distractions, besides also giving them ample time to train, noting that they have stayed for long without training owing to Covid-19 situation," said Aluoch. The National Paralympic Committee of Kenya (KNPC) will take 37 athletes, 12 guides and 15 officials to the 2021 Dubai Athletics Para Grand Prix due February 7-14.
At the same time, KNPC will require Sh26 million to successfully take part in the Dubai event that will form part of the Tokyo Olympic Games qualification.

The team was named during the one-day trials on Monday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.
KNPC president Agnes Aluoch disclosed that they have already written to the Ministry of Sports regarding funding, noting that the Sh26 million will be used towards the team’s 10-day camp before departure, accommodation and allowances.
“We also require to purchase one T54 special wheelchair for racing and some competition kit, especially the spikes,” said Aluoch, adding that she is confident the government will respond positively to their financial request.

So far, four Kenyans have qualified for Tokyo Olympics, 2016 Rio Paralympics 5,000m T11 champion Samwel Muchai, Nancy Chelagat, Hellen Wawira (powerlifting) and Asia Mohammed (Para-rower).
“The numbers are bound to increase with more qualifying events line up. More so, we shall only take athletes who will have shown good form hence qualifying alone isn’t the ticket,” warned Aluoch.
