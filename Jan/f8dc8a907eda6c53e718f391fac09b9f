Sainz, whose son Carlos drives for Ferrari in Formula One, finished 25sec ahead of French teammate Stephane Peterhansel after a gripping see-saw battle which record 13-time champion Peterhansel appeared to have won until Sainz stormed home to deny his celebrated rival.
Czech Martin Prokop (Ford) completed the first day's car podium.
While Sainz leads Peterhansel by eight seconds in the fledgling standings, for another luminary of the rally world the 2021 Dakar had barely begun before it was all but over.





Nine-time world rally champion Sebastien Loeb trails by more than 24 minutes after a day to forget.

But the opening day proved tough going for reigning champion Ricky Brabec, Honda's American rider who trailed in almost 20 minutes behind Price after losing his way in the early part of the 277km special.

Launched in 1979 between Paris and the Senegalese capital Dakar, the celebrated endurance challenge moved to Saudi Arabia for the first time last year after a decade in South America, sparking angry reaction from human rights organisations who accused the kingdom of 'sports-washing'.
