In a conciliatory tone, Governor Kiraitu said he is keen on working closely with all Meru leaders.Meru Woman Rep Kawira Mwangaza and Eala MP Mpuru Aburi said they are not ready to settle their differences with the governor. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has extended an olive branch to his rivals as he seeks to solidify his political base ahead of his 2022 re-election bid.
In a New Year message, Governor Kiraitu said part of his 2021 resolutions is to mend fences with Meru Woman Representative Kawira Mwangaza, East African Legislative Assembly (Eala) MP Mpuru Aburi and other political rivals.

The two politicians have been a pain in Mr Kiraitu’s governorship, with several public spats being witnessed in 2020.
Ms Mwangaza has since announced she will run against Mr Kiraitu in the 2022 gubernatorial contest while Mr Aburi, a friend-turned-foe, is drumming up support for the governor’s main rival, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya.
But, in a conciliatory tone, Governor Kiraitu said he is keen on working closely with all Meru leaders, adding that “living in conflict with others is like chasing the wind.”

“As part of my new year resolutions, I intend to have a cup of tea with my political rivals and extend my friendships. I will engage Kawira Mwangaza to see what it is we are fighting about. This will ensure we perform our duties without fighting each other. I will also look for Aburi so that we mend fences,” the governor said in an interview with a local TV station.
He said he will work hard this year to encourage amicable resolution of differences among political leaders since it is the last opportunity to deliver on development.
“I will also meet the members of county assembly to chart the way forward,” he said.
Political enmity 
In the last three years, Governor Kiraitu has been working hard to assimilate his political rivals, including raiding CS Munya’s camp.

Last year, the governor scored a major win against Mr Munya after ending a 17-year political enmity with Igembe North MP Maore Maoka.
However, Mr Kiraitu’s differences with Mr Aburi and Ms Mwangaza intensified the same year, leading to court battles and public spats.
The governor sued Mr Aburi on accusations of defaming him while Ms Mwangaza’s premises were raided by Meru County revenue officers on claims that she had failed to pay for various licences, allegations she denied.
But, speaking to the Nation on phone, Ms Mwangaza and Mr Aburi said they are not ready to settle their differences with the governor.
“My differences with the governor are not personal but due to lack of development. As long as the governor remains lazy without delivering development, I cannot be friends with him. When I asked questions about lack of development, they sent revenue officers to harass me,” Ms Mwangaza said.
Mr Aburi, who is also the National Ordinary People's Empowerment Union (Nopeu) party leader, said he would only meet Mr Kiraitu after “he leaves office in 2022”.
“Let the governor know that I am not ready to befriend him now. I am supporting Munya to unseat Kiraitu next year. I can only engage him when he is out of office in 2023. When we founded the Nopeu party, he was quick to dismiss us as a passing cloud,” Mr Aburi said.

Mr Kiraitu said 2020 was a difficult year when his administration was unable to execute any development due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
