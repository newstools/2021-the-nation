In politics, no elected leader - especially a president - wants to be associated with failure. 
The term lame duck refers to an elected politician about to exit office at the end of his tenure, especially when a successor has already been elected or will soon be.
In case of a term limit, such leaders are, more often mistakenly thought to wield less power and influence due to the limited time left in office.

In Kenya, lame duck has been applied rather differently. The Deputy President William Ruto and a few politicians from Mt Kenya region have been attacking the President.
They have been trying to depict the President as a king without influence even in his own backyard.
Convinced he is well on course to achieve this goal, Dr Ruto has in recent weeks unleashed his Rift Valley allies to publicly dismiss the President.





To the DP and his allies, this may appear like a smart political move. But it will soon prove to be a gross miscalculation that will cost him dearly.
During his first term, President Uhuru chose to focus on development as opposed to politics.
Upon realising that it was not going to be easy to run the government in a final term with a fractured country after the 2017 elections, he embraced opposition leader Raila Odinga to unite the country.
While Dr Ruto has since orchestrated a rebellion within Jubilee Party, the President focused on his work.
But it is not hard to tell that the President is deeply upset by the defiant leaders who rode on his popularity to clinch power.
He has made it clear he is totally in charge.
The President has warned those out to sabotage him saying: “usione simba amenyeshewa ufikirie ni paka” (do not mistake a rained on lion for a cat).

He has also warned his friends-turned-rivals that he will get involved in succession politics.  
Those opposing the President should realise that other than being the Head of State, President Kenyatta remains the undisputed kingpin of Central Kenya, the vote-rich block the DP hopes to use to ascend to power.
The President will have a major say as to who succeeds him in 2002.  
It is a matter of time before Dr Ruto realises the impossibility of ascending to power without his   boss’ blessings.
While a lame duck status appears to neutralise the incumbent, it also frees them to act firmly since they do not need the favour of re-election.  
The President may opt to shatter Dr Ruto’s State House dreams. 
They should learn lessons from the ruthless manner in which the President kicked out Jubilee Party stalwarts from leadership positions in the National Assembly and the Senate last year.
The DP should resist the urge to take Uhuru’s kindness for weakness.
