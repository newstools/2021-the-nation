Trump and his mob defiled the US Capitol because he had created a toxic political environment characterised by fake news, alternative facts, lies and deceit, which gave him the opportunity to treat the Constitution, institutions, best practices and traditions with contempt. Well, he did disrupt Congress proceedings that January 6 but not Wednesday’s peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden.





Trump’s behaviour highlights the risks associated with populist leaders. He made it public that he admired and supported populist leaders like Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte and Indian Prime Minister Mahindra Modi, accused of extrajudicial killings and citizenship discrimination, respectively.
Public interests
Populist leaders make the masses believe that they are pursuing national and public interests while, in fact, they are chasing selfish interests. These are seldom consistent with national and public interests. Talented in mischief, they create fanatical near-religious support with most of their supporters being sucked into the irrational and emotional space.
A cursory glance at Kenya’s elected leaders reveals that we risk the US slide. One does not need to be at par with Albert Einstein to see populist DNA in some of the elected leadership and 2022 candidates. Establishment politicians are coming up with anti-Establishment narratives yet they are insiders.

They claim that the Establishment has abandoned anti-corruption and democratic ideals while they are responsible for policy growth and development.
They are running on socioeconomic populism by catalysing class war politics, claiming that the masses are bleeding at the feet of big business and capital owners aided by the Establishment. They eloquently describe the problem but fail to offer a solution despite their having been elected to do so.
Suffering
A good number of Kenyans are suffering from the Stockholm syndrome — where hostages or abuse victims bond with their captors or abusers. Voters are falling in love with the architects of grand corruption.
Perpetrators of class wars. Failures in offering fiscal and monetary leadership. This is in conflict with the theory of rational behaviour, which assumes that people would rather take actions that benefit them than those that harm them.
Such captors and abusers deserve contempt.
Kenyans must run away from the binary thinking that the 2022 presidential race is limited to two populist candidates. Visionary public and private sector leaders must present themselves to the electorate lest our country slide into populist leadership.
