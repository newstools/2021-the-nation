The last time the juniors were on the courts competitively was in November 2020 when Tennis Kenya held the Senior and Junior challenge series tournament after almost nine months of inactivity. The first of an eight series tournament that ran between November 23 and December 10 featured both men and women and saw some of Kenya's top talent turn up to compete at the Nairobi Club under strict Covid-19 rules and regulations. Kenya will host the the first ever International Tennis Federation (ITF) World Junior Circuit at the Nairobi Club.
The debut outdoor clay court event will be played across eight weeks this year. Three weeks in January, two in July and three in November respectively. The January event is scheduled to start on the 18th and run for three straight weeks with 17 countries participating including India, France, Russia, Norway alongside the hosts.

Tennis Kenya President James Kenani told Nation Sport that the success of the event will be used to gauge how the rest of the year will be for tennis considering that the players have a lot of compensating to do after a year that went to waste due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
"We are enthusiastic about starting the year on a high and it is our honor that we have been trusted to host this event by ITF. We intentionally used the last event of 2020 to get the players to warm up and get their heads back to competing and remind them that winning requires continuous practice regardless of their circumstances," he said.





Tennis Kenya had only four tournaments last year including the East African tennis championships, the BNP World Team Cup Africa Qualifiers, Davis Cup Euro/Africa Group 2 playoffs and the Tennis Kenya Senior and Junior Challenge series. The annual Kenya Open, Nairobi Open and Karen Open were cancelled due to the rise in the spread of the virus across the globe.
In the ITF World Juniors tourney girls category, Kenya will have top seed player Angela Okutoyi, currently ranked 271 in the ITF Junior rankings, her twin sister Roselida Asumwa, newcomer Debbie Akoth, Cynthia Wanjala and Shakira Varese.
