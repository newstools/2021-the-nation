Kenya has officially taken up its position as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, six months after beating Djibouti to bag the seat.
Kenya’s flag was Monday hoisted at the UN headquarters in New York alongside those of nine other holder of non-permanent seats, signalling the beginning of the country’s two-year term at the UN’s most powerful organ — 23 years after it last sat on the seat.

The win, which Kenya secured after beating Djibouti in a second round of voting last year, had been hailed by President Uhuru Kenyatta as historic, and one that would secure the country’s position as a regional and global power player.
Kenya won 129 votes against Djibouti's 62 votes in the June voting, more than two-thirds – the number required under the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, to win the seat.





“Kenya will endeavour to consolidate and voice Africa's position in the Security Council and will advance its 10-point agenda as outlined during the campaign period,” Mr Kenyatta said after the June win.
Huge mission
But winning the seat was not a walk in the park. Kenya faced stiff competition from Djibouti despite an endorsement by the over 50 countries making up the African Union as the continent’s choice for the position.
Kenya invested every tool available to lobby member states of the UN, including appointing a special envoy from the ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the AU Catherine Mwangi and Lazarus Amayo, permanent representative to the UN in New York.
Kenya also invited permanent representatives to the country, gave out lapel badges and sent emissaries to campaign at every international forum before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world.

Now working with the five permanent members of the council – Russia, UK, US, China and France – all who enjoy veto powers, Kenya will join nine other non-permanent members and could get a chance to preside over the Council’s sittings, an influential opportunity to influence agenda.
AU's power
The entry to the council also serves to assure the world of the legitimacy of the African Union (AU) in endorsing candidates from member states to “act in its name.”
The AU had endorsed Kenya for the seat, but Djibouti rejected this decision and went ahead to conduct parallel campaigns for the only seat allocated for Africa, a position that in some ways exposed the fractures within the 55-member AU.
Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh had last year congratulated Kenya on its win, saying he hopes that Nairobi will bring “valuable debate” to the Council.
Kenya will now be part of key decision making on global peace and security. Some of the decisions may include sanctions, authorising use of force to preserve peace as well as electing judges of the International Court of Justice.
