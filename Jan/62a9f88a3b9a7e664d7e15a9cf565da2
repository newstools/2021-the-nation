World Bank reports show that over one-third of household-run businesses closed down.Hospitality and tourism haven't fully recovered yet, while transporters have to deal with a curfew that delays deliveries. The vote by Parliament late last year to have the Covid-19 tax relief measures reversed makes it clear that the government has decided to have just a few Covid measures in place.
All these would have been all right were it not that the pandemic did not leave Kenya the way it found it.
According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 1.7 million Kenyans lost their jobs last year, while the economy contracted by 5.7 per cent.

So where is the economic recovery plan? Asking for prosperity and a thriving economy from the Jubilee government would be asking for too much, given that they have been unable to deliver for the past seven years.   Kenyans' lives have changed for the worse.

It is time leaders talked to citizens to find out what they want. Before the pandemic, projects used to be stuffed down their throats: from laptops to railways and other grand projects that served to enrich a few while increasing the country's debt to astronomical levels. We have tasted the plans the government has for us and we do not wish to partake more of them.
 It's not like the pre-Covid times were good. The unemployment rate stood at 39 per cent according to the 2019 census results, the highest in the region.
But that was better than what we have now.  We are simply asking to be taken out of the fire back to the frying pan.
Where is the economic recovery plan for the losses we have undergone during the pandemic? Do they have any in the first place, or are we just sailing into an abyss?
