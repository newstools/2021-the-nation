Slovenian sensation Doncic finished with 36 points, 16 rebounds and 15 assists to record his 29th career triple-double to pass Michael Jordan and move into 15th spot on the all-time list.
A frustrated Doncic said the blame for the loss rested squarely on his shoulders because he played selfishly.
"The second half, I played terrible," Doncic said. "That's on me, that game. I was being selfish a little bit because I had 30 points in the first half. 





"That wasn't me in the second half. I've got to do way better in the second half. That's just on me."
Doncic shot 11-of-18 from the floor in the first half. He finished with six three-pointers.
Doncic became only the fourth player in NBA history to record at least 35 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game and the youngest to do so. Oscar Robertson did it five times. 
The Bulls had six players in double-figure scoring as their bench outscored the Mavericks reserves 61-22. Chicago's ball movement was outstanding and their defense compiled a season-high 14 steals.

Julius Randle scored 20 points and pulled down 12 rebounds and RJ Barrett added 19 points and 11 boards for the Knicks, who spoiled the season debut of Celtics All-Star guard Kemba Walker, absent from the first 11 games with a left-knee injury.
Walker departed in the third quarter with an apparent rib injury, but said he was happy to be back.
"It felt really good to be out there," Walker said. "I kind of forgot how good it feels to be out there."
