Another vehicle has plunged into the Indian Ocean at the Likoni channel, two days after a similar incident involving a tour bus.
Early Wednesday morning, a semi-trailer truck lost control while boarding MV Kilindini ferry on the mainland side and fell into the ocean.
The driver of the truck escaped unhurt during the 4.15am incident.

According to Kenya Ferry Services (KFS), the driver lost control after hitting the ferry's prow, causing the truck to plunge into the sea.
"The truck had one occupant who escaped unhurt. The salvage operation is underway," read a brief statement from KFS released Wednesday morning.
The management notified ferry users that a delay might be experienced at the channel as ferries are landing on one side of ramp.

Tidal movements
A towing truck had already arrived early morning to help in retrieving the vehicle. KFS said it was waiting for the tidal movements to go down before the truck could be pulled out of the water.

The incident happened two days after a bus belonging to Pollman Tours and Safari Company also plunged into the sea at the same spot.
The bus slid into the ocean while embarking from MV Jambo ferry on Sunday on the mainland side of the channel.
The bus driver, Salim Omar, and his conductor, John Omutere escaped death narrowly. Together with his conductor, Mr Omar was rescued by local divers and fishermen.
According to Mr David Jomeli, a registered civil engineer, the steep ramp should be redesigned to help curb the increasing cases of cars plunging into the ocean.
Mr Jomeli, the technical director at Kenya Federation of Master Builders (KFMB) and a frequent user of the channel, added that a barrier at the end of the ramp would also help.
