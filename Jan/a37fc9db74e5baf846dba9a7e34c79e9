Politicians allied to the Jubilee party and Deputy President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) are preparing for a showdown as the Rurii Ward by-election . 
The mini poll, whose date is yet to be set, will have local and national implications, including at the Nyandarua county assembly, where at least nine of the MCAs who opposed the ouster of Speaker Wahome Ndegwa are allied to the DP camp.

In county and national politics, Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia and Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki will be leading the Jubilee brigade while Women Representative Faith Gitau will be leading UDA's. 
A wing by UD will be a big blow to Mr Kimemia, who is a strong supporter of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee.
If the by-election is held before the BBI referendum, the poll results might be an indicator of where Nyandarua residents lie in terms of the handshake and the BBI.

});
}, 62000);

Others on the UDA side are Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho, with the legislator expected to use his position to influence voters to the DP's side.

During the funeral of the late MCA Mburu Githinji, Mr Kiaraho said he was committed to ensuring that all development projects initiated by him are completed. 
“He was very concerned about electrification, a project we have started implementing with Kenya Power in honour of the late MCA,” said Mr Kiaraho. 
The UDA section claims that the seat belongs to them and that Mr Githinji was a member of the Hustler Movement. 
But Nyandarua Majority Leader, King’ori Wambugu, dismisses this, saying the late MCA was a Jubilee loyalist and was among those that signed the impeachment motion against Speaker Ndegwa.
