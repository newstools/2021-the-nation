Washington,
President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged calm and said he opposed any violence among supporters as Congress debated his impeachment for inciting insurrection.
"In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.

"I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You." No president has been ousted from office by impeachment, but even the threat can bring one down. Lawmakers in the lower chamber are expected to vote for impeachment around 2000 GMT. Bobi Wine has also revealed that his National Unity Platform (NUP) party has established an independent tallying centre to check against potential rigging. The move means Ugandans will cast their ballots amidst an internet blackout.
