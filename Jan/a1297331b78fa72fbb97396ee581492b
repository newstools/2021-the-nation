Past incidents
In August last year, President Salva Kiir ordered his country's aviation authorities to promptly investigate a plane crash that left eight people dead, according to South Sudan’s Red Cross.
The order came after a chartered plane belonging to the South West Aviation Company crashed shortly after taking off from Juba International Airport.
Last July, a South Link aircraft crashed in the defunct Fangak State in Greater Jonglei State while transporting humanitarians. There was no death.
In September 2018, South West Aviation Company’s plane crashed in Yirol Town of Lakes State killing over 20 people including the Bishop and other government officials.

Allies want him to name his successor as region’s kingpin in order to tame Ruto’s growing influence in his political backyard. The ODM leader says Kenya is a multi-ethnic society, hence the need to be sensitive to the ethnic differences. Experts are concerned about the rapid spread of new variants of the virus.
