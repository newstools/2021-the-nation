The Egerton University Council has appointed Prof Isaac Ongubo Kibwage the acting vice-chancellor after retirement of embattled VC, Prof Rose Awuor Mwonya.
Prof Mwonya’s tenure officially came to an end on January 12 after attaining the mandatory retirement age of 70.
Interestingly, she has moved to court to fight the decision to have her retire, saying she is entitled to serve until she is 74.

The matter will come up for hearing on January 14.
The announcement declaring Prof Kibwage the acting VC was communicated to students and staff in a notice dated January 13.
"In exercise of the powers vested in Section 35 (1) (a) (i) of the University Act No 42 of 2012, as amended in 2016, and after making necessary consultations, the Council has the honour of appointing Prof Isaac Ongubo Kibwage, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Administration, Planning and Development, as Acting Vice-Chancellor with immediate effect," said the Egerton University Council Chairperson Hukka Wario.





Give full support
Dr Wario, who signed the notice at the Njoro campus on Wednesday, urged staff, students, parents and alumni, partners, stakeholders and friends of the university to give the new acting VC full support.
This is the second time Prof Kibwage is being appointed the acting VC of the financially troubled university which is reeling in debts amounting to over Sh3.3 billion.
Among the list of debtors include pensioners’ funds, saccos, part-time lecturers, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), private hospitals and other suppliers whose debt has been pending for years.
Prof Kibwage was first appointed acting VC on November 20, 2020 following a circular issued and signed by the university’s Registrar for Human Capital and Administration, Dr Thomas Serem.

However, as the power struggle intensified, on December 2, 2020, Prof Mwonya issued a general notice to staff and students and insisted that she was still the substantive VC of Egerton University until further notice.
