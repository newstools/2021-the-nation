"Our best is yet come but forcing the big two( GSU and Prisons) to five-set thrillers shows something. Our main objective this season is to play in the play-offs.
We are going to intensify training as we look forward to the forthcoming fixtures. We have a relatively young squad that is eager to deliver and that is something we are proud of," said Kirongo, a former men and women's national team coach.





The Bankers succumbed to GSU 2-3(16-25,25-21,25-18,25-22 and 13-15) and Prisons 2-3(3-2 (25-17,25-27,27-29,25-16 and 15-13), but beat Kenya Army 3-0(25-15,25-19,25-15).
The results left them with five points from three matches, one behind Prisons who have six points from three matches.

KPA team manager Joel Kosgei said they intend to stay at the top.
"If the first leg results are anything to go by, then there are no clear favourites atleast for now. But we hope to be in the play-offs," said Kosgei. 
In the women's category, former champions Kenya Pipeline top the league standings with six points from two wins against league returnees Nairobi Water (25-13,25-18,25-18) and league debutants Nairobi Prisons (25-17,25-17,25-15).
Pipeline team captain Rose Magoi said there is more ground to cover and remains hopeful the team will get better in their subsequent league matches.
KCB are second with four points from one win against Directorate of Criminal Investigation (25-18,25-19,25-16) and a 2-3(24-26,26-28,25-21,25-16) loss against champions Kenya Prisons.
Prisons complete the top three positions with three points after their win against KCB. Kenya was drawn in pool 'C' alongside Cape Verde, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. KCB were tipped as favourites to win the match considering their star-studded squad. The pardon came after his meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, who is on an official tour of Tanzania. The cases failed to kick off to allow prime suspect Lawrence Njoroge Warunge to undergo a mental exam. The country has raised security concerns after Somalia’s federal and regional forces renewed fighting at Bula Hawa in the Gedo region.
