Three PSG players had already tested positive for the virus in the last week -- Brazilian Rafinha, German player Thilo Kehrer and French youth international Colin Dagba. 
Former Tottenham coach Pochettino has overseen three PSG games so far, notably winning the Champions Trophy in Lens on Wednesday thanks to a 2-1 win over bitter rivals Marseille.
Pochettino took over from Thomas Tuchel and signed a contract until June 30, 2022 with an option for an additional year.





Tuchel was sacked on December 24, reportedly for comments viewed as critical of the Qatari owners despite having led the team to a maiden appearance in the Champions League final last season.
Pochettino also played for PSG from 2001 to 2003. Dutch Phillip Cocu was sacked in November. United moved three points clear of Jurgen Klopp's men on Tuesday.
