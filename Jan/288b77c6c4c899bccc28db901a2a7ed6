North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has blamed lack of coordination in campaigns for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) in Mt Kenya region for the document’s lukewarm reception and called for a change of approach.
He said majority of the residents have not seen the document and rely on hearsay, thus its dismal performance.

Speaking Saturday at Meru Police Station where he opened a Sh800,000 ablution block built by the local NG-CDF, Mr Dawood said good leadership would help convince more people to embrace BBI.
He said he shares Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata’s sentiments in the letter addressed to President Uhuru Kenyatta, but said there is still time for improvement.
“I agree with his sentiments that we are not going in the right direction since the booklets have not been distributed. It is not right to lie to the President that all is well. We want the document so that people are educated on it so that they can make an informed choice,” said Mr Dawood.

Mt Kenya leaders’ meeting
He agreed with Tifa findings that suggested that BBI is still slow in penetration in the area.
Mr Dawood said Mt Kenya leaders will this week meet to look at the problems facing the document and ensure smooth campaigns.
He appealed to the residents to embrace BBI, saying no document could be perfect for everyone, just like the 2010 Constitution which faced massive opposition.
“BBI campaigns are disjointed, even DP Ruto is not opposed to it per se. The document is generally good and can be changed after some time if it doesn’t serve us well. Even the 2010 Constitution was not perfect,” said Mr Dawood.
