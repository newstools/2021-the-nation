Four breathing machines that reportedly went missing in Migori County have been recovered amid a backlash from residents, who are demanding accountability from senior officers in the health department.
This comes barely a day after the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) released a statement indicating that the county received two ventilators on December 22.

The agency said the county also received two Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines in May as part of government donations.
The machines donated by the World Bank in support of the fight against Covid-19 were collected on December 22 by the county’s Health Chief Officer Dalmas Oyugi, according to Kemsa.
The agency further insisted that the two ventilators were collected from its Embakasi Supply Chain Centre, denying implications that the World Bank had donated four.

Kemsa received the distribution list of the ventilators from Afya House on November 19 and released the two ventilators to Migori County as per the distribution list” read part of the statement by Kemsa.
Investigations
Investigations carried out by the Nation at Migori County Referral Hospital revealed that the county was in possession of 10 ventilators and two CPAP machines sourced from the agencies.
Health Executive Kephas Nyamita and the chief officer, on Wednesday termed the reports of missing equipment as “misleading”, weeks after Governor Okoth Obado took issue with Kemsa “for failing to produce the consignment, months after it was donated by the World Bank”.
On December 21, Mr Obado challenged Kemsa to deliver four ventilators that were donated to the county by the World Bank, noting that the consignments were yet to be delivered to the facility months after they were donated in July.

});
}, 62000);
}



“We’re still expecting Kemsa to give us our ventilators. Dr Iscar Oluoch being part of this team should help us locate the ventilators,” Mr Obado said, adding that the county would not be lagging behind if all the ventilators were brought to the facility.
Kemsa is entangled in a multi-million scandal involving illegal procurement of Covid-19-related supplies.
Col Nyamita and Mr Oyugi, in an interview with the Nation at Migori Referral Hospital, confirmed that the county procured four ventilators earlier in the year before receiving four others from USAid a fortnight ago, while two others and the CPAP were supplied by Kemsa on December 22.
“I want to be categorical that of all the equipment in our possession, none is missing. There is a misconception going round, which was occasioned by four other equipment from the World Bank that are yet to be delivered,” Mr Oyugi said. Lobby piles pressure on the government, noting investigations into the Kemsa scandal and others are still incomplete. The 6.1-tonne consignment of pentavalent vaccine arrived in 2017 and expired the following year due to clearance issues. The new year has a rude welcome in the end of the Covid-19 tax reliefs.
