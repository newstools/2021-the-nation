In her New York Times best-seller, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, Kamala Harris, one of America’s most inspiring political leaders, wants the future generation to hear, learn and be encouraged by action that she and many others are taking. “I don’t want us to just tell them how we felt,” she writes. “I want us to tell them what we did.”

Ms Harris grew up with integrity to do what is right, and throughout her career — from starting out as a prosecutor right up to her position as California’s Attorney-General and US Senator to the Vice-President of the United States — she has supported the truth with all her might.
She has managed to break a number of glass ceilings, and this “joyful warrior” has not been afraid of being cut — she has waged battles and endured tremendous criticisms. She was the first black woman from her state, and only the second in the nation’s history, to be elected senator. Now, she is the first woman, first black and first Asian-American VP of America.





She was raised by a single mother who valued social justice and taught her that she had power and agency not only to see but also to act. That “It’s too hard” is never an acceptable excuse; being good means standing for something larger than oneself; and success is measured in part by what you help others achieve and accomplish.
As a progressive prosecutor, Ms Harris looked out for the overlooked, spoke up for the unheard, saw and addressed the causes of crime, not just the consequences, and shone a light on the inequalities and unfairness that led to injustice. She knew equal justice was an aspiration.

Kamala Harris urges young people not to fixate on distant dreams, but to focus on the work right in front of them — and the rest will follow. To play their part in solving some of the challenges in the society since what matters is how well you run the portion of the race that is yours. Credit goes to President Biden for nominating Kamala Harris as his deputy. She will return to the US Capitol for what is likely to be her first official act: the swearing-in of three newly elected Democratic senators. DP Ruto accused of coming up with new pledges without fulfilling earlier promises. A spot check by Nation on Tuesday found no signs of the cross slab. BBI Bill to be tabled in all the counties after IEBC verified 1.14 million signatures.
