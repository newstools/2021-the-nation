National cross country champion Sheila Chelangat and Charles Yosei, winners of the second leg in Mosoriot, Nandi County on December 19 have also stayed away from the Ol Kalou leg.
Nevertheless, a record turnout of 600 athletes is expected in Ol Kalou. AK’s Nyandarua County branch chairman, Kamau Mfae, said the bumper entry in Ol Kalou is owing to the proximity of Nyahururu town that has many training camps.
“We have an estimated 400 athletes training in the nearby Nyahururu town. We expect more athletes from the adjacent environs. Most athletes are eager to shade off the rust, having not competed for the better part of last year owing to Covid-19 situation,” said Mfae.

Mfae said the prevailing warm weather and terrain are perfect for a cross country championship.
“This time the weather is very warm unlike the previous editions. We have also been inspecting the course and the terrain is very suitable for a cross country event,” he said.
The leg was supposed to be held on January 9 but was brought forward to January 2 to allow athletes ample rest before they embark on the regional and institutional cross country championships, which commence on January 13.
AK has been working closely with the Nyandarua County government to put Covid-19 measures in place by setting up the required hygiene facilities at the venue. “They have provided us with running water, sanitisation booths for washing hands and sanitisers,” Mfae said.
