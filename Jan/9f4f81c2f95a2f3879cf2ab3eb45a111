“We are sure of reaching the group stages but with thorough preparations devoid of strikes and go-slows caused by delay in paying salaries. 

“Gor have a good squad now, and some of the players in Napsa camp were with us therefore we can say we know a few things about them,” said Ochieng’. 

Former K’Ogalo duo of Timothy Otieno and custodian Shaban Odhoji are currently with Napsa. 

Former Mathare United player Andrew Tololwa also plies his trade with the Zambian Premier League side that is in the process of acquiring the services of Kenya international David Owino “Calaber”, another  former Gor Mahia defender. 

Gor’s Ugandan-born striker Tito Okello also told Nation Sport that the draw was favourable to them. 

“It is important we win at home. We should also avoid conceding easy goals. Despite the recent heavy defeat, we have to stay focused,” said Okello.

K'ogalo will be at home in the first leg slated for February 14 with the reverse fixture in Zambia on February 21. 

Gor were bundled out of the CAF Champions League in first round by CR Belouizdad of Algeria 8-1 on aggregate. 

The Kenyan champions had seen off familiar opponents APR of Rwanda in the preliminary round 4-3 on aggregate. 

Napsa are currently 16th in the 18-club Zambian Premier League table on seven points, 13 behind leaders Prison Leopards. 

Without a coach and assistant and with the players on strike, Gor Mahia management will be hard pressed to smooth matters at the club. 

A juicy carrot for the players is a guarantee of Sh27 million for the club from Caf as prize money for advancing to the group stage. 

The club has already settled one month salary out of the two owed to the playing unit. 

Gor have had mixed fortunes in the Confederation Cup over the past three seasons. The winner will proceed to Confederation Cup group stage. It is also a wonder that Gor technically did not have a coach.
