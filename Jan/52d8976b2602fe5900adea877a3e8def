Mr Kabura was charged before Chief Magistrate Mathias Okuche with an alternative count of committing an indecent act with a minor.
He was also charged with a second count of child sex tourism.
Magistrate Okuche heard that the military officer ferried the minor intending to defile her.
The case will continue on January 19.
He was released on a Sh200,000 bond.
The Kenya Army soldier is said to have committed the heinous act in Kiriaini market, Nyeri County.
A police statement said the soldier volunteered to drop the 16-year-old girl in her school.

“The suspect abruptly made a stop-over at Kiriaini market where he booked into a room at around mid-day and allegedly defiled the schoolgirl. After the ordeal, he bundled the girl into the car and sped off towards her school,” the statement said in part.
School reporting time
The girl was rescued following an accident that occurred on the Nyeri-Mweiga highway at around 6pm, way past the school reporting time.
Police escorted the girl to the Nyeri County Referral Hospital for examination while the soldier was detained at the Nyeri Police Station.
The latest incident comes just a month after a police officer at Clay City police post allegedly raped a woman he had arrested and detained at the post.

According to the victim, she was on her way home way past curfew time when the officer, identified as Constable Wilson Waruta, arrested her and took her to the police post along Thika Road.
At the time, Mr Waruta was the only officer that night, and he found the woman alone in a spot notorious for petty crimes at around 2am.
The woman was the only detainee of the night at the police post. Mr Waruta allegedly raped and sodomised the woman at the station before releasing her in the dead of the night.
He then walked out of the police post shortly afterwards and has not been seen or heard from since.
The woman reported the incident at Kasarani Police Station the following day, and officers immediately started investigations.
