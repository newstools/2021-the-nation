K'Ogalo players have not trained since the CR Belouizdad match even after the Mashemeji derby game against arch rivals AFC Leopards originally slated for Saturday was postponed to give them ample preparation time. 






Other players also revealed that during the January transfer window they may opt to leave and sign for other clubs which, at least are prompt in salary payment however little it is. 

“I will not go back to the pitch and honour any game if the club doesn’t pay me my dues. I was really ridiculed by my family members that despite playing for a big club, I couldn’t do any shopping for them during the holidays,” said an influential senior player in the squad who wished not to be named. 

Bad debts 

Another one said that he did not have any motivation to train and was disturbed by thoughts of clearing debts and looking for school fees for his dependants. 

“People are on my neck because I borrowed and promised to refund when I get paid  I am really disturbed and don’t know what to do since even my rent is in arrears. I am thinking of leaving for another financially stable club even if it participates in the lower league,” said another.

The players strike has bothered Posta Rangers coach Sammy Omollo who is standing in at Gor for their African assignments. 

Omollo said that under the current circumstances the club should forget about  overturning the 6-0 deficit. 

“I doubt if those boys can come back to the pitch for any training session if they are not paid. The issue is tough because the club also has no money and we may end up playing with only available players who have not even trained,” said Omollo.

The ex-Kenyan international and former K’Ogalo defender however ruled out a walkover saying he is sure some players will turn up on match day. 

“Since we are the home team, I doubt if it can be a walkover. We might not train, but I know some players will sympathise and be available on match day,” he added. 

He also ruled out coaching Gor on permanent basis due to the wrangles at the club,revealing he will go back to Posta Rangers for league assignments. 

Gor doesn't have a coach and an assistant after sacking 60-year-old Brazilian Roberto Oliveira over lack of coaching papers while his assistant Patrick Odhiambo has moved to Bandari in the same capacity. 






As K’Ogalo woes deepens, CR Belouizdad are expected in the country on Sunday evening ahead of the return leg.

The club is unbeaten in the last eight matches both in the league and Caf and warmed up for Wednesday's game with a 3-2 victory over JSM Skikda in the Algerian Premier League on New Year's eve. The Kenyan champions toured Algeria at the weekend for the 6-0 thrashing by hosts CR Belouizdad. He is currently unattached and is living in Kumasi, Ghana. Drama ensued early Saturday when the Kanu chair went to Kapsisiywa for coronation as the Kalenjin kingpin. Clinical officers agree to go back to work as more discussions take place, joining doctors who were first to return to work. In the coming months, the “Ruto parties” will avail themselves of a chance to show their mettle.
