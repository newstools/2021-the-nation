 Economic recovery funds, incentives and innovativeness of the private sector should be used to structure win-win public private partnerships. We should build on the dividends of education by encouraging technical and vocational trainings. Kenya has many missing links in the national development which we must address in 2021.  We need to reset our politics and make them issue-based, moving away from insults and empty rhetoric in play; leaders should dutifully assume their positions either in government or in the opposition, where the latter should offer alternative and workable ideas.

On the economic front, workable economic recovery strategies are required to reboot the economy, including deliberate efforts in developing household savings and financial literacy.
 Economic recovery funds, incentives and innovativeness of the private sector should be used to structure win-win public private partnerships (PPPs). PPPs are low-hanging fruits in leveraging money quickly into direct employment creation that is highly needed at this stage in our lives.





This should begin by financing already vetted and approved projects, which are easily activatable and can circumvent typical delays.
Such projects can enhance connectivity to already developed infrastructure, including accelerating development of rural access roads to boost agriculture. This will make voters more enlightened.
Technology-savvy
On social aspects, we need to continue building sustainable and cohesive communities through increased, viable and genuine peacebuilding initiatives to address underlying causes of animosity. Communities must be made to understand that others matter.
We should scale up and leverage our position as a technology-savvy country to address access to services, quick response to pandemics, droughts, disasters and restoration of services where they are disrupted.

Environmental conservation through afforestation, conservation of water catchment areas and promotion of safe human habitats should be encouraged as global warming and climate change impacts are on the rise.
We should build on the dividends of education by encouraging technical and vocational trainings. Let’s enact laws that advance our collective interests.
