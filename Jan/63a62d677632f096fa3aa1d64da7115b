A police officer attached to Nguruki Police Post in Maara Sub-county in Tharaka Nithi County on Thursday reportedly committed suicide by hanging himself at a neighbour's house.
Maara Police Commander Mohammed Jarso confirmed the incident and said the officer, 35-year-old Bruce Mwenda Kibaara, could have been suffering from depression.

“Initial investigations show that the officer took his own life but we are going on with investigations to establish what exactly transpired,” said Mr Jarso.
Philis Nkinga told journalists that the officer came to her home, picked a panga then started cutting his throat.
Fearing an attack, she rushed to lock herself in her house and started screaming for help.
On hearing the screams, the villagers came and found the officer inside a small room, locked him inside then rushed to inform his colleagues at the police post, which is about 500m away.





Harriet Kinyua, Nkinga’s daughter, said the officer, who comes from Muthambi in the same sub- county, is well-known to residents but has reportedly been sick for a long time. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years. His wife was rushed to the Kenyatta National Hospital in serious condition. The officers who had tear gas confiscated the group's placards before protest activities began at Jeevanjee Gardens. The two properties were purchased through the funds suspected to be proceeds of crime and corruption. Isiolo Senator Dullo, the only PDR lawmaker, insists she was not consulted on changing the party name.
