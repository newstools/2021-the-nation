Kenya Roll Ball Federation (KRBF) Secretary General, Yusuf Kipkoech, said the teams will be assembled next month to start preparations as they intend to retain the respective titles.
Kipkoech said the earlier they start preparation for events, the better for the teams if they are to guard the good results they have posted previously.
"We have the World Cup in Dubai in December where we have done extremely well and we want to maintain the momentum, but this can only be achieved if we start early preparations," said the official.





In 2019, the women's team won the World Cup that was held in India, while their men counterparts finished second behind the hosts.
Kipkoech said logistics are being put in place for the KRBF National League to kick off.
"We held the teams managers' meeting last weekend and we need some adjustments on some things before we hit the ground running. There have been open tournaments in Nairobi and the talents that have been showcased prove that we cannot run short of players as a nation," said Kipkoech.
