The electoral commission has rescheduled the Machakos senatorial by-election from March 23, 2021 to March 18, 2021 so as to allow for a smooth running of the national examinations scheduled for the week of March 23.
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chairman Wafula Chebukati said they had been informed by the Ministry of Education that the national examinations have been scheduled for the week of March 23, thus conflicting with their initial schedule.

The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Boniface Kabaka (Chama Cha Uzalendo) late last year.
IEBC had also set February 18 for the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election following the impeachment of former governor Mike Sonko but the High Court on Monday suspended a Gazette notice calling for the vote.
In his ruling, Justice Anthony Mrima temporarily stopped the mini poll on the basis of Sonko’s petition challenging the process that led to his ouster late last year.





Other by-elections
Other planned by-elections to be conducted by IEBC on March 4, 2021 and whose timelines have not been affected include those for Matungu and Kabuchai constituencies and five for members of county assemblies for Hell’s Gate and London wards in Nakuru County, Huruma, Kiamokama and Kitise/Kithuku wards in Uasin Gishu, Kisii and Makueni counties respectively.
“The timelines in part, as contained in the Gazette notices in the schedule herein and pursuant to Section 31 (2b) and (2c) of the Elections Act number 24 of 2011 provide that a political party submits to the commission names of persons contesting in its party primaries before the nomination day and that the commission shall publish the said names in the Gazette,” Mr Chebukati said.

He disclosed that the commission had equally shared the list with the government printer for publication.
“Further, Section 32 and 33 provide that persons intending to contest as independent candidates shall submit to the commission symbols they intend to use in an election.
“The commission in turn is required to publish in the Kenya Gazette, the names and symbols of the persons.”
The IEBC Chairman noted that the names and symbols of the aspirants had also been forwarded to the government printer for publication.
He reiterated that the publication of names of persons contesting in party primaries and those intending to contest as independent candidates is not “clearance of candidates to contest in an election”.
“Clearance of candidates for purposes of contesting in an election is done during the days set for nomination by the respective returning officers that have been duly appointed by the commission,” said Mr Chebukati.
