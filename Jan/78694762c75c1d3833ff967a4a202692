It will be the first tough fixture this season between the two sides whose rivalry dates back to the 80s.

Kisumu All Stars were relegated to NSL after losing the KPL/NSL play off to Vihiga United on penalties on November 4.
Hot Stars, who played in the Division One League last season, were handed a slot to the NSL after the disbandment Chemelil Sugar due to massive financial constraints.
Obungu said his side is ready to bag the bragging rights in the derby so as to cut the two point deficit between them and All Stars in the league.





"We are ready for the derby and our target is to ensure we bag a win because we are a big club here in Kisumu. Our training sessions have been good and just because they played in the top league last season doesn't give them an edge over us in the match," Obungu told Nation Sport.
However, Kisumu All Stars coach Salim Babu chided their opponents saying he doesn't know even where they are training, yet the claim they are a big club in Kisumu.
"They are always noisy claiming they are the biggest team in Kisumu and referring to other teams as minnows. What have they won? Are they above us in NSL?. I even don't know where they train," wondered the former Western Stima coach.
"NSL is not easy and every team has to fight to win but I am surprised that they are bragging as if they have won already. We are prepared to silence them. We have dominated football in this town and I don't understand the basis of their claims," added Babu.
