Deputy President William Ruto yesterday stayed clear of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) politics, asking leaders to stop dividing the nation along ethnic lines at the expense of development.
In a conciliatory tone, the DP who was speaking in Uasin Gishu, appealed to leaders to strive at ensuring that the country remains one.

Dr Ruto lamented that politics of handshake and Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) have derailed the government's Big 4 Agenda, insisting that leaders must come together for the sake of the programmes to be implemented before the 2022 General Election.
"The things we managed to accomplish in our first term – constructing railway, several roads, electricity connectivity, water – but we were caught up in an emergency of handshake and BBI. We are trying to resolve it, so that we embark to the main agenda why you elected us, " said the DP.





Dr Ruto also challenged those in the opposition not to focus on the undoing of the government in terms of development but use the handshake for the sake of helping them to deliver on the development projects.
"Since our opponents decided to join us, now, we must accept that we need to walk together. Let it not reach a point where we blame each other. Let us desist from grouping mentality and divisive politics along tribes, this takes Kenya backwards.
DP Ruto admitted that the country faces a number of challenges from debts to coronavirus pandemic but assured Kenyans that time has come for the government to fulfil campaign pledges.
His diehards who accompanied him during the burial at Tarakwa, Kesses constituency drummed up support for the newly unveiled party, UDA.

Led by Jubilee deputy secretary-general Caleb Kositany, they suggested that they are done with the ruling party arguing that with the UDA, there will be no more humiliations.
“We are happy that a party affiliated to the Jubilee has changed its name and we are all in it, those who have been bullying us, let them relax and be ready for a competition,” said Mr Kositany.
His sentiments were echoed by Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, who noted that the UDA is going to unite all people and be ready to liberate the collapsing economy.
“Hustlers’ train has left today, it will deal with problems of mama mboga, bodaboda and other groups, we will never be intimidated anymore,” he said.
The DP’s men accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of sidelining his deputy and all those who are leaning towards him.
Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, an ardent defender of DP Ruto, said the UDA belongs to allies of DP but not himself.
He, however, challenged the second-in-command to back them even if he decides to remain in the ruling party arguing that the Head of State has been siding with their political foes, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Politicians led by Johnson Muthama, Susan Kihika and Kipchumba Murkomen say they have found peace and equality. Uhuru put in place a new House leadership after a bloody purge of perceived rebels allied to his deputy, Ruto. The man who holds a Nigerian passport was on Friday night arrested in connection with a gruesome killing in Syokimau. Stephen Thuku was reportedly blocked by another car at Nairobi’s Githurai Mwihoko area by three armed men. Politicians express their views on matters including the 2022 poll and Mudavadi's position as Mama Hannah is buried.
