The stadium will have changing rooms, a media center, a board room, modern ablution block, eight lanes running track and ample parking.To speed up the process, the president stated that the government will pump Sh100 million towards the construction of the Jaramogi Sports Complex, whose initial funding was Sh111.3 million. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday reminded the contractor in charge of construction of the Jomo Kenyatta Stadium in Kisumu to meet the April 2021 deadline.
That means the contractor, Cornel Osano of Chaju Builders Limited, has about three and half months to complete the Sh1.4 billion project that was launched by the President on October 22, 2020.

"You assured me the last time we were here that works will be completed by April. Is that so, let that be done," Mr Kenyatta told the contractor, moments after his 20 minutes tour of the facility and being briefed on the progress.
The construction of the main dias is about 40 percent complete, while the terraces haven't been completed yet.
The main football pitch and track meant for athletes is yet to be laid.
Mr Kenyatta was speaking in Kisumu on Sunday when he toured the facility together with opposition Chief Raila Odinga, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o, his Deputy Dr Mathews Owili and County Commissioner Josephine Ouko.

When Mr Odinga visited the stadium last month, he pointed out the need for further structural adjustments in the ongoing multimillion construction of the facility in Mamboleo, Kisumu.
Mr Odinga then said he would approach President Uhuru Kenyatta for additional funding to fill the missing gaps in the ongoing construction. Whether this was part of the discussions yesterday is unclear as the media was kept at bay as the leaders toured the facility together.
Mr Kenyatta is keen on having construction of Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium and the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Complex expedited so that they can be ready for sporting activities within the region.

Last year he also directed Dr Fred Matiang'i, Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government, to have the Kisumu Boys-Mamboleo Road and Mamboleo-Muhoroni Road leading to the stadium completed to ease access to the facility.
The president said a match pitting local football rivals Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards will be played during the official opening of the stadium in April
The construction of the 12,000 seater facility will replace the abandoned and dilapidated Agricultural Show grounds in Mamboleo and will have football, rugby, tennis, hockey pitches among others.
The stadium will have changing rooms, a media center, a board room, modern ablution block, eight- lane running track and ample parking.
