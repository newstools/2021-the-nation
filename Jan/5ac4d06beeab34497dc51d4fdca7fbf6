Mr Njuki said when he took over as governor, he found reports of great initiatives by Mrs Mbae, mainly touching on the girl child.
“On behalf of my family and the county residents, I send my sincere condolences to the former governor Ragwa for the great loss,” said Governor Njuki.
Prof Kindiki wrote, “Condolences to my friend Hon Ragwa on the unfortunate and profound loss of your dear wife. My prayers, those of my family and the county fraternity are with you during this painful moment.”





Kenya National Museums of Kenya Director General, Dr Mzalendo Kibunjia, described Mrs Mbae as a people’s servant and a dedicated educationist.
“Our prayers and thoughts are with the family of Hon Ragwa during this challenging moment,” said Dr Kibunjia.
Businessman Muthomi Micheni said Mrs Mbae will be remembered for her humility and selfless heart. Outgoing US President will be at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when Biden is sworn. The battle is for control of a Sh20 billion estate in Nairobi’s upmarket Kitisuru pitting two siblings. President Trump has left the White House and President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn shortly as the 46th President of the United States. Outgoing US leader, who refused to accept his defeat for more than two months, never congratulated Biden on his victory. Donald Trump will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration ceremony.
