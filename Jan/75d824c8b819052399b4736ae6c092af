Kenyans with adequate doses of the vaccines, the issue of affordability sticks out like a sore thumb. Since the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, many countries have adopted the concept of essential medicines. As the world celebrates the discovery of several vaccines that can ameliorate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the all-important issue of access to these lifesaving technologies in developing countries cannot be ignored.

Access has many dimensions and implies four facets: Affordability (Can I pay for it?), availability (Is it available near me?), acceptability (Does the formulation meet my needs) and adequacy (Does the healthcare system meet my expectation?)
Assuming that sufficient studies have been done to understand the acceptability of the Covid-19 vaccines among African populations and that there is enough manufacturing capacity to provide Kenyans with adequate doses of the vaccines, the issue of affordability sticks out like a sore thumb. This is the principle that governments and policymakers will grapple with now and in the coming days.





Developing countries should take advantage of exemptions in the World Trade Organization’s (WHO) Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or Trips — namely, compulsory licensing and parallel importation.
With compulsory licensing, a country can suspend the patent holder’s right to market exclusivity and manufacture a product within its jurisdiction to expand access to the medicine, especially in public health emergencies.
Technology
To avoid the inevitable confrontation with pharmaceutical companies, some countries ask patent holders to allow local firms to make the same medicines or technologies under licence. Parallel importation seeks to take advantage of differences in prices of a medicine or technology in different markets.

Pharmaceuticals segment markets based on many factors, key among them the ability of a population to pay a certain price for a product.
For instance, because of the low cost of production in South Asia, a drug from India may be several times cheaper than the same one made in Europe or Kenya.
But countries that have tried to use compulsory licensing and parallel importation have had their arms twisted by developed countries, where the big pharmaceuticals are influential and substantial taxpayers. Such was the case in South Africa in efforts to bring down the cost of patented HIV/Aids drugs.
Countries have come together as a bloc to move a certain volume of commodities and negotiate better prices. WHO has made efforts to have this in place for Covid-19 vaccines for developing countries.
International organisations such the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and UNITAID, an international drug purchasing facility, have also intervened further upstream by directly negotiating with manufacturers to bring down the price of essential medicines and health technologies.
Kenya needs such tools in its arsenal to make essential medicines and health technologies more affordable to all, both in the public and private sector.

The court has suspended a Gazette notice calling for the Nairobi by-election following a case by impeached Governor Mike Sonko. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age.
