Big Vic officially unveiled in Nairobi as a UN Habitat brand ambassador.He is a good coach on and off the pitch...always willing to help you, says Montreal midfielder in Nairobi. Harambee Stars captain Victor Wanyama says he is happy to work under Arsenal’s legend Thierry Henry at Montreal Impact in Canada, as the Frenchman knows how to get the best from his players. 

Wanyama joined Montreal Impact in March 2020 on a three-year contract from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in a free transfer.

He played 22 matches for the club in his first season in Major League Soccer, scoring two goals and providing one assist -- a performance he said he is proud of, as Covid-19 pandemic had affected him. 

“The first season was a little bit difficult because of Covid-19, but when we were back to playing, it was good and the team performed well, so I am happy with my first season. 

“Because in every season you need to aim higher. Hopefully everyone can come back fit and we can take it from there and do better than last season,” said Wanyama.

Montreal Impact play in the Eastern Conference of the MLS. 

Wanyama was speaking on the side-line of  a ceremony where he was unveiled as a brand ambassador for UN Habitat in Nairobi. 

 “I have got a good relationship with Thierry. He is a good coach on and off the pitch. He is always willing to help you.” 

In October last year, Henry was captured blasting Wanyama and his teammates in their 3-2 league defeat to New England Revolution. 

“Mason was there Victor. No, don’t scream. Mason was there! Mason, tell him you were there alone,” Henry told Wanyama on the touchline of the match. 

Henry joined Montreal Impact on a two-year contract in November 2019 and guided the club to a ninth place finish last season.

 In his new role as a UN Habitat ambassador, the former Spurs man, through his organisation – Victor Wanyama Foundation, will seek to improve the lives of slum dwellers through initiatives that boost access to water, providing education and sanitation. 

“There is a lot that we can achieve, and for now it is just to do things step by step and make sure we make changes. We have done some other things before like giving scholarships to kids, so there is a lot we are going to do to change the lives of people  living in slum,” said Wanyama. 

Oumar Sylla, the Africa Director UN Habitat said that by partnering with Wanyama, they hope to reach more people. “There is more expected from us at the community level and that is the reason why we are here today to seal this memorandum of understanding.” 

Last year, through Victor Wanyama Foundation, the Kenya midfielder built a new house for a family of five who were living in an old structure at the Korogocho slums in Nairobi. Together with UN Habitat, he also provided 7,000 masks to Mathare and Kibera residents in August.   

Wanyama added that he is happy with the on going construction of his football academy in Busia. He said it will house world class facilities when complete.

});
}, 62000);
}




He said he was inspired to put up the facility from the challenges he encountered during his early years as a football player in Kenya.

});
}, 62000);

“For me, it has been my dream to one day give back to the community and try and improve what I did not have when I was growing. 

“That (football academy) is the biggest thing we lacked here. To have that facility and the same system that they have in Europe here will make a big difference,” said Wanyama. He called on corporate organastions to join him in the initiative.
