General Lee gave David Miri a more than decent ride in the Junju Handicap shelving favourite, Unforgettable, for Mary Binks and Stewart McCann.Peter Kinuthia and Onesmus Mutua were back in business with a tidy double. Establishing himself once again as one of Kenya's finest, Silverstone Air (James Muhindi), made light work of the Mzee Wa Pwani Trophy for Captain Somow.
Silverstone Air is all quality. Just push a button and boom - off he goes.
Western Ballad was not quite her usual brimming self, being thwarted for second place by Pharoah's Advocate. Gold Pot was unable to navigate the tricky bend, supporting his love for only sprinting in future. He was not even roaming in the neighbourhood.

So, who was missing from Ngong? None other than our Champion jockey, Lesley Sercombe, under the miserable spell of flu - nothing to do with Covid-19.  
The Ganze Maiden was maybe a low-key event for some, but not for young 20-year-old, Tony Kuria, winning his first race as a trainer, and, part-owner. How stirring is that? Well done Tony. Keep it rocking.

General Lee gave David Miri a more than decent ride in the Junju Handicap shelving favourite, Unforgettable, for Mary Binks and Stewart McCann.
As previously stated, Algy is a very good horse, but has issues with starting. Yesterday no such obstacles. He almost caught Firing Line in the Alpa Romeo Trophy- a short-head judgement is encouraging for Oliver Gray. Lady Eccles was happy to be competing down the straight, forging a laudable third.
Peter Kinuthia and Onesmus Mutua were back in business with a tidy double.

Next Meeting January 24 - for the Kenya Guineas, Manchester, and, Nakuru Race Club Cups Silverstone Air and Western Ballad have been adversaries for ages. He will be taking on Western Ballad, Fast Five, Clothes Horse, Pharoah's Advocate and Harbour Bay. The former Nairobi governor also explains why he did not file an election petition. The university student is now the prime suspect in the multiple homicides his parents, brother, cousin and his father's worker. Tough-talking President Kenyatta tells off his critics, saying he is fully in charge of the country.
