Frantic efforts were made Sunday to convince Gor Mahia players to return to training for their Champions League first round second leg match against Algeria’s CR Belouizdad.

Gor lost the first leg 6-0 on Boxing Day in Algeria and, realistically, can only advance if a miracle were to occur.
Only 10 players showed up for training Sunday under Posta Rangers coach Sammy Omollo, who is helping out at the club in the absence of a Caf certified tactician.
Gor Mahia team manager Jolawi Obondo told Nation Sport that every effort was being made to get all the players in training and he expected a full house Monday.

“It is true this is a difficult time and we urge the media to at least give us positive coverage as we marshal our players to come back for training. The issue at hand which is salary payment is being sorted by the management of the club,” said Obondo.
