The ward representatives sought to know why the county wanted to pay the firms and exclude lawyers who sufficiently represented it in court.They accused some of their counterparts, who have labelled themselves “super MCAs”, of being behind a plot to arm-twist the county into paying law firms they fronted. Drama unfolded at City Hall on Monday after more than 10 MCAs stormed the offices of the county attorney and the chief finance officer, demanding to know the status of the payment of at least Sh500 million to 25 law firms.

The MCAs first camped at CFO Halkano Waqo’s office for close to an hour, seeking to know whether he had given the go-ahead for the money to be released.
They then proceeded to County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka’s office on the same mission, spending close to 30 minutes there.
The drama comes after the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) launched investigations into a possible collusion of several leading law firms and Nairobi MCAs to swindle the county government of close to Sh500 million in legal fees.

The probe centres around payment of legal fees to the firms between 2013 and 2020.
The commission has asked the Nairobi county secretary to furnish it with specific case files handled by the 25 law firms in that period, including details of the cases, letters of instruction and contract agreements.
Selfish interests
Led by Dandora Area 4 MCA Francis Otieno, the legislators accused some of their counterparts, who have labelled themselves “super MCAs”, of being behind a plot to arm-twist the county into paying law firms they fronted.

Mr Otieno wondered why the said wanted the payments expedited yet City Hall has been unable to release bursary funds weeks after schools reopened.
“We will not allow some of our counterparts to use county money to advance their selfish interests. Why were they pushing to have the law firms paid yet they don’t apply the same energy in having bursary money released?”

“Let the officers not bow to pressure to pay the law firms. If they do,it will not be business as usual at City Hall.”
He was with ward representatives including David Okello (Huruma), Jared Akama (Mugomoini), Redson Otieno (Ngei), Maurice Gari (Nairobi West), Moses Ogeto (Kilimani), Lawrence Otieno (Sarang’ombe), Alvin Palapala (Kitusuru) and Clarence Munga (Kabiro).
The MCAs claimed that the firms were to be paid the millions last Friday, only for the plan to grind to a halt following the shocker from EACC.
CFO's response
Mr Waqo dismissed the MCAs’ claims, saying he was not aware of such payments and the law firms being bandied around.
He said, however, that if such a list exists, the county will follow the law in making the payments.
“There is so much speculation, with people trying to create stories from nowhere and intimidate and threaten people. We will do everything within the law and as guided by financial regulations. We have no choice as we are dealing with public resources,” he said.
According to the payment schedule, Njenga Maina and Co advocates was to get Sh40 million, Tom Ojienda and Associates Sh30 million, E N Omoti and Co. advocates Sh30 million, Wanjiku Maina and Co Advocates Sh25 million and Kwanga Mboya and Co advocates Sh45 million.

comulo@ke.nationmedia.com The probe comes after Nairobi MCAs raised concerns over the payment of large amounts of money to certain law firms. Kang’ata says he reads political mischief in the new probe. The pardon came after his meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, who is on an official tour of Tanzania. The cases failed to kick off to allow prime suspect Lawrence Njoroge Warunge to undergo a mental exam. The country has raised security concerns after Somalia’s federal and regional forces renewed fighting at Bula Hawa in the Gedo region.
