Tunis
The Tunisian president's chief of staff has been hospitalised after handling a suspicious letter addressed to the Head of State, Kais Saied, his office said Thursday, suggesting an attempted poisoning.
Nadia Akacha had opened the envelope addressed to Saied but found it empty and later suffered from short-term vision loss and headaches, and was briefly hospitalised, according to a statement from the presidency.

She was discharged on Wednesday but is still suffering from headaches and is being monitored by doctors, the statement said.
Another employee, who was in the same room with Akacha when she opened the envelope, had similar symptoms but of lesser intensity, it added.
Tunisian media suggested the letter may have contained ricin, a poison that can be lethal in high doses.
The presidency did not say when the incident occurred but stressed that Saied did not come into contact with the envelope, which was eventually destroyed, and was in good health.





Launched investigation
Authorities have launched an investigation to analyse the contents of the envelope and are awaiting the results, Tunis prosecutor Mohsen Dali said.
There were no suspects so far, he added.
Tensions are high in Tunisia, following wrangling over a cabinet reshuffle and growing unrest that has seen protesters take to the streets to demonstrate against poverty, unemployment and police repression.
Saied has said he was not consulted about Tuesday's reshuffle, during which Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi named 11 new ministers to the interior, justice, health and other key portfolios.
The president, an independent academic, has charged that one of the ministers was involved in a corruption case and that three others were suspected of conflicts of interest.

The political tensions also involve a power struggle between Saied and the Islamist-inspired Ennahdha movement, which came out on top in October 2019 parliamentary elections. There is anger at a political class seen to be disconnected from the suffering of ordinary people. Country has seen political and social instability in recent weeks. They are the new chair and vice chair succeeding Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), respectively. Jubilee party official says BBI was sold in Mount Kenya by force “and Murang'a Senator did nothing bad to highlight these issues to the President.” Minister says new time zone is based on South Sudan’s location on the globe.
