Dennis Simiyu scored in the 86th minute to seal maximum points for the visitors in a match attended by a handful of Gor Mahia fans.
K'Ogalo had recorded identical 3-1 wins against Mathare United and Western Stima on January 14 and Western Stima respectively but Vihiga United proved a hard nut to crack from the onset.

This is the first defeat for Gor's Portuguese coach Carlos Manuel Vaz Pinto since taking over three weeks ago.
It was also the third defeat for the reigning champions this season after playing six games, three less than other teams.
The result means K’Ogalo drops to 10th position still on nine points while Vihiga move to 14 on eight points from nine matches.

Vihiga United coach Sammy Okoth was full of praise for his charges bragged that the win shows that without a red card in a match, they can beat any team in the league.
"We have had red cards in three matches this season and this time we were full house. I can authoritatively say Gor is always being aided by their fans to win matches. The win motivates my team and I am confident with this determination, we can be among the top teams in the league," said Okoth.
Okoth said his players followed his instructions and converted the best chance that came their way late in the second half.
"Throughout the game we contained them and had we converted the few chances we got, we would have won by a huge margin. Gor is a beatable team and our focus now turns to next game against Sofapaka as we aim for our place up in the table," he added.
A visibly disappointed Vaz Pinto conceded that his strikers didn't utilise the many chances that came their way in the match resulting in the defeat.

"We really missed a lot of chances and that finally cost us in the game when they scored. It is a painful defeat but we forge ahead and focus on our upcoming matches. Vihiga was also a good team and they defended well in the game," he added.
Solid Vihiga
Vihiga United were solid at the back keeping out K'Ogalo's attacking trio Clifftone Miheso, Tito Okello and Samuel Onyango for the better part of the game.
Vihiga were the first to threaten in the fifth minute through a freekick taken by Dennis Ombeva but Joachim Oluoch cleared the danger.
K'Ogalo's first real chance fell to Okello whose header from captain Kenneth Muguna's free kick in the 22nd minute went inches over the bar with Vihiga keeper Alube well beaten.
Vihiga thought they had won a penalty in the 25th minute after David Simiyu was brought down in the box by Charles Momanyi but the centre referee ignored the incident.
Sammy Okoth made the first change after the restart bringing in Michael Odongo for Johnstone Kidambu.
Simiyu blew a way good chance in the 53rd minute, shooting wide with Gor Mahia's custodian Boniface Oluoch well beaten.

Two minutes later, the misfiring Okello failed to convert a clear chance, releasinga powerful shot that flew over the bar.

Vaz Pinto made two changes, bringing in John Macharia and Burundian Jules Ulimwengu in the 65th and 71st minute for Samuel Onyango and Alpha Onyango respectively. He also replaced the jaded Miheso with Sydney Ochieng in the 80th minute.
In the 86th minute, Simiyu rifled home from close range past Boniface Oluoch following a mix up in Gor Mahia's defence to give the visitors the lead.
Gor wasted two clear chances in stoppage time through Macharia and Ulimwengu to suffer their third defeat of the season. Vihiga United have only one win in eight matches played so far.
