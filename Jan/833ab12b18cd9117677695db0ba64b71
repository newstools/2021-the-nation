Kenyans on social media have scored another win against CNN after international broadcaster edited a story claiming that a Caucasian woman from London had discovered whales in Kenya.
This comes after the media house received backlash from Kenyans. 
“A headline on an earlier version of this story overstated Jane Spilsbury's role in finding whales in Kenya. She was instrumental in documenting their migration. An earlier version of the story also included two quotes from Spilsbury that overstated her role. Those quotes have been removed,” said CNN after the article.

In the article, which had the headline “The woman who found whales in Kenya”, Jane Spilsbury, a former London lawyer, claimed that she had moved to Kenya, where heard tales from residents about whales and dolphins and took it upon herself to document the mammals, whose existence local residents had said they had known about for more than 30 years.

});

“Up until recently, most travellers, and even some locals, had no inkling of the aquatic mammals that occupy or pass through Kenya's waters,” Spilsbury had been quoted as saying in the article by Ashleigh Stewart.
In another quote, she had said: “We literally came from a point of zero information and zero awareness, it seems ridiculous to imagine that nobody knew that the dolphins or whales existed here”.
And in another: “We were amazed, because no one knew there were dolphins out there, not even the Kenya Wildlife Service”.
CNN has now removed these quotes and changed the story's headline to "The woman who helped reveal whale migration in Kenya".
This was not the first time the broadcaster had angered Kenyans. In 2015, Kenyans on Twitter roasted the broadcaster for a report on President Barack Obama’s visit to the country, in which they said he was heading to a “HOTBED OF TERROR”.

} An article on the broadcaster's website says former London lawyer heard tales from local residents about whales and dolphins and took it upon herself to document the mammals. Kenyans on the micro-blogging sites, Twitter and Facebook, criticise the global television network All funds will be channelled directly through implementing partners. Deliberations of the secret night meeting resulted in the explosive letter that has ignited the current raging fire.
