The news will be a disappointment to the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) and Kenya Primary Schools Sports Association, the two bodies charged with organising school games in the country.
KSSSA chairman Peter Orero in earlier interview with Nation Sport said they would meet with Ministry of Education to discuss on how to resume the games.
“Not all students are good in books, some have other talents and these games have shown that. So it is only prudent that we also be allowed to resume our competitions next year, Orero, who is also the principal of Dagoretti High School, noted.





KSSSA has already held seminars across the country to train teachers on how to conduct games under covid-19 protocols.
The resumption of some sports in the country last year had offered hope to the officials of the two bodies when schools re-open today countrywide.
Last year, the duo were unable to hold a number of their championships as schools were closed due to Covid-19.
KSSSA had lined up a bevy of activities for the year that would culminate in the country competing in the World School Games in Jinjiang, China for the first time. The East Africa Secondary School Games were also due to return to Kenya after a four-year absence.
