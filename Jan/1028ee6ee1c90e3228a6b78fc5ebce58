Kigumo divisional police commander (OCPD) Michael Ndegwa said the accident involved a matatu that was heading from Kangare town to Nairobi.
"At a place known as Kwa Mukangema near Heho town, the vehicle rolled several times, Investigations will ascertain the cause of the accident," he told Nation on phone.
Mr Ndegwa said investigations will also establish whether the vehicle belonging to Nairobi-Mugoiri (Namu) Sacco was operating in line with Covid-19 transport protocols, on matters including the number of passengers.





The OCPD termed the accident unfortunate, saying the initial report cited an error of judgment by the driver as the likely cause.
Immediately after the accident, police patrols were mounted along major routes in the area to ensure adherence with the transport protocols. At least three people have died and 25 others injured following a road accident involving an Eldoret Express bus at Matulo along the Webuye-Bungoma Road. Three other people, including the driver and two other occupants of lorry, also perished. The officers who had tear gas confiscated the group's placards before protest activities began at Jeevanjee Gardens. The two properties were purchased through the funds suspected to be proceeds of crime and corruption.
