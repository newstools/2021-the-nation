'Engineer' had not found the target in his first two matches against Al Sadd and Qatar SC since joining from Kashiwa Reysol where he had also not scored in his last match in Leavain Cup final.
He put Sabri Lamouchi’s side 1-0 up from the spot in the sixth minute after Brazilian Eduardo Pereira Rodrigues (Dudu) was brought down in the box.
Dudu received a pass from Olunga and was about to shoot with his left foot before he was fouled. Olunga was given the penalty-taking duties and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way with a powerful shot.





Brazilian Edmilson Junior Paulo doubled the lead for the Amir Cup holders 16 minutes later from an assist from Dudu after a poor pass.
Edmilson turned provider for Olunga two minutes from half time after floating in a corner nicely finished off with a header by the 2020 J1 League Player of the Year and Golden Boot winner.
Olunga grabbed his hat-trick on 69 minutes before Luiz Martin Ceara made it 5-0 in the 78th minute. Things went from bad to worse for Al Ahli when Ghanaian defender John Benson was sent off five minutes from time, with Edmilson completing the rout in the 90th minute.
In the last 10 encounters between the Qatari sides, Al Duhail have won all with an aggregate score of 37-7.

Olunga’s penalty was his second in the five foreign leagues (Sweden, China, Spain and Japan) he had played in before moving to FIFA Club World Cup-bound Al Duhail. He has scored most of his goals abroad from open play with his left foot, headers and a few right-footed shots.
Olunga scored his first penalty against Shonan Bellmare in July 2020, the same month he missed another against Vegalta Sendai.  
He joined the 2019-2020 Qatar Stars League champions on January 12 from Japanese side Kashiwa Reysol.     
In other Amir Cup matches Monday, hosts Qatar SC were knocked out 3-2 on post-match penalties by Al Shamal, as Al Wakrah lost 1-2 to visitors Al Kharitiyath.    The 26-year-old centre-forward asserted that everyone is ready for the Al Ahli confrontation in the Amir Cup. Ochieng made his senior debut in November 2016. The pardon came after his meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, who is on an official tour of Tanzania. The cases failed to kick off to allow prime suspect Lawrence Njoroge Warunge to undergo a mental exam. The country has raised security concerns after Somalia’s federal and regional forces renewed fighting at Bula Hawa in the Gedo region.
