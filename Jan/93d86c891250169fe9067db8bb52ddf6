Unfortunately, during the second pandemic wave, we have dropped our guard.Relevant government administrators, health officials and citizens seem fatigued. 2020 will stand as a challenging year as 1982 and 2008. Covid-19’s devastation is comparable to that occasioned by the 1982 attempted coup ’de tat and the aftermath of the 2007 post-election civil strife.
Coronavirus caught us unawares. Substantial budgetary resources had to be diverted to deal with the pandemic in response to an overstretched health system.

The national government employed extra health staff and interns to augment the personnel numbers. Also, counties supplemented their health personnel.
Personal protective equipment, ICU facilities and other oxygen delivery systems were also required as well as an enhanced risk allowance and comprehensive medical cover.
Unfortunately, during the second pandemic wave, we have dropped our guard. Relevant government administrators, health officials and citizens seem fatigued. This must radically change. And we must also prioritise making the Covid-19 vaccine available nationally.

Covid-19 has disrupted the educational system. Most school-going children and young people have missed school, college or university for almost a year. We have to endeavour to recover the lost time. As learners reopen this month, Covid-19 protocols must be religiously followed.
Covid-19’s economic impact is massive. Loss of jobs — both formal and informal — and businesses has been astronomical. Between April and June 2020, it was estimated that 1.7 million jobs were lost.
In 2020, we witnessed an unprecedented urban-rural migration. Many micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises also collapsed countrywide.
Although the government has a major revenue shortfall challenge, the previous tax holiday should have been retained. Countries abroad such as the US are giving relief to unemployed citizens.

Article 41 of the Constitution guarantees labour rights. Nurses, clinical officers and now medical laboratory personnel are on strike. Courts have declared the strikes illegal and recommended negotiations.
The demand for provision of protective gear for frontline workers, appropriate promotions, reasonable risk allowance, and comprehensive medical cover should be addressed.
The health workers’ unions are advocating that all their members and those on contract be retained or employed on permanent and pensionable terms and their salaries enhanced.
However, Kenya’s ballooning wage bill is unsustainable. Already, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have raised the red flag. Further, there is an ethical dimension regarding health personnel withdrawing their services during a pandemic.
Therefore, an honest dialogue between the unions and both the county and national governments is necessary. Although the President has declared total war against corruption, Kenya has been consistently ranked in global graft indices as one of the most corrupt countries.
In jurisdictions where the fight against sleaze has been successful such as Botswana, the battle begins to be waged at the top.
Although Article 77 of the Constitution restricts full-time State officers from participating in any other gainful employment, in other nations, the officers are barred from doing business while in office.

A government parastatal runs the businesses of those who enter public office until they leave office. Kenya could explore this route. Wealth declaration by public officers should be made public. Any wealth that is not declared should be forfeited to the State. 
EACC should be an independent institution established within the Constitution. Periodic lifestyle audits of public officials should be mandatory. Public officials should disclose any companies and other economic entities that they have interest in.
All public procurement, except that of a security nature, should be made open so that all data on procurement is permanently available to all for scrutiny.
Although as a country we pride ourselves as a democracy that follows the rule of law, we have habitually fallen short of Article 10 on the values and principles of governance. The country’s leadership needs to recommit itself to the culture of rule of law.
Elephant in the room
The elephant in the room in the world, and more so in Africa, is how to productively and effectively engage the youth. They make up 70 per cent of the population in Kenya. It is the most educated, energetic, potentially innovative and creative segment. 
Unemployment and lack of entrepreneurial opportunities are the major drawbacks facing this group. Without economic democracy for this segment, current measures to deal with youth dis-empowerment will only be palliative.

From the dawn of independence, ethnicised politics has been firmly entrenched on Kenyan soil through competition among the elites of the major five populous communities of Kikuyu, Kalenjin, Luo, Luhyia and Kamba.
A united inter-ethnic elite divides Kenya into tribes, then they symbolically unify them in pre-election, and sometimes post-election coalitions. Such elite is not interested in creating a nation out of Kenya’s micro-nations by championing the politics of ideology.
Even when the kingpin rallies his community into a coalition, it is the kingpins and a select few in the tribe who benefit. Even some elite of the other 41 ethnic groups are admitted into what Taban lo Liyong called ‘eating chiefs’.

The question is begged: When will the majority of the Kenyan population, those who want to run clean business and others desirous of a better and prosperous nation, be mainstreamed into the society?
As of September 2020, the national public debt stood at about Sh7.121 trillion, just shy of the Sh9.0 trillion mandated ceiling. Both debt repayment and the recurrent expenditure are almost consuming the entire current revenue raised by KRA. We need to tame appetite for debt to avoid consigning Kenya into economic doldrums.

As we begin the year, on the cards are the BBI referendum, a series of by-elections and the 2022 elections. Political formations have started to crystalise. Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee, Raila Odinga’s ODM and William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance are the emerging main political outfits. Other small parties are waiting to embrace the handshake coalition.
Reform activists are trying through Kongamano La Mageuzi, Linda Katiba, Kenya Tuitakayo, other civic groups and their associated nascent political parties to find space in Kenya’s politics.
2021 will be the year in which we could witness erosion of the 2010 Constitution through the BBI constitutional amendments which, inter alia, seek to constitutionalise the hegemony of the major ethnic groups in the country through a pentagon shaped national executive.
Democratic constitutions are always negotiated. Currently, no law exists to guide the referendum process. However, to force BBI on the citizenry is to burn bridges, not to build bridges.2021 is a make or break year for Kenya, and we must handle it with utmost care.
kivuthakibwana2017@gmail.com Usually the departed are accorded immense respect irrespective of how they lived. The level of public participation and other civic engagements has been compromised by the Covid-19 pandemic. The boat is said to have been carrying two families who are residents of Kampi Samaki and Kokwa area. Senator Moi’s office condemns the Nandi incident, terming it an act of cowardice. The Ministry of Health has reported 55 new recoveries, bringing the tally for national recoveries to 79,012.
