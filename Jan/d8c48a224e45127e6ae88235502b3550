The list, compiled by different editors and writers, is by no means exhaustive.But it is a window into the soul of a country in an year many would like to forget. Despite 2020 being a devastating year due to the pandemic, some Kenyans made us proud. But others had time to spare from fighting coronavirus to make the country cringe. Cringe in fear and shame. 

However they made us feel, the men and women in this list elicited different emotions in all of us. 

The list, compiled by different editors and writers, is by no means exhaustive. But it is a window into the soul of a country in an year many would like to forget.

Dr Doreen Lugaliki 

The 39-year-old obstetrician had since March worked hard to keep Coronavirus patients alive at Nairobi South Hospital when she caught the dreaded disease. 

On July 10, 2020 Dr Lugaliki became the first Kenyan doctor to succumb to Coronavirus, just eight days after she first exhibited symptoms. 

Dr Lugaliki’s siblings checked her into Aga Khan Hospital after she started feeling unwell.

The gallant soldier’s demise showed Kenyans, first hand, the real risks frontline workers face in caring for Coronavirus patients.

Dr Lugaliki’s colleagues praised her for giving her life in the line of duty, terming her July 13, 2020 burial date as “Black Monday”. 

"We as a family will greatly miss the laughter our daughter created and the united she always brought to the family," her mother said, weeping. 

Doreen was set to marry Mr Fred Mboss this year. Mr Mboss’ family was awaiting easing of travel restrictions to kick-start dowry negotiations. Captain Daudi Kibati and Captain Salah Salim Jeizan 

When Kenya Airways offered to fly home Kenyans stranded in the United States for free, the noble act largely fell on Mr Daudi Kibati’s shoulders. 

The 61-year-old retired Kenya Airforce Major, ranked as captain at KQ, flew the Dreamliner 787 that brought home several Kenyans stranded in one of the cities hit hardest by the Coronavirus.

The flight from the John F. Kennedy Airport was to be the last of KQ’s fleet to evacuate Kenyans. Unfortunately, it would also be Mr Kibati’s last. 

Mr Kibati landed the plane at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on March 24. He proceeded into quarantine at the Ole Sereni Hotel in Nairobi alongside his first officer. 

Five days later, Mr Kibati tested positive for Coronavirus. 

The disease showed him no mercy, as Mr Kibati succumbed three days after testing positive.

Unbeknown to the airline, they would lose another pilot to Covid-19 eight months later. 

57-year-old captain Salah Salim Jeizan succumbed to the disease on December 2 in a London hospital where he was receiving treatment. 

In November captain Jeizan developed breathing difficulties at his hotel in London. Preceding that, he had flown his aircraft from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Heathrow Airport in London. He was rushed to the hospital and put on oxygen. 

After a month long admission, the captain unfortunately succumbed, and was buried in London under Islamic law. The senior captain had joined the national carrier in 2001 as a junior pilot, rising to the position of a senior captain on the Boeing 787 fleet. Dr Stephen Mogusu

Much like Dr Lugaliki, Dr Stephen Mogusu spent his last days on earth caring for Coronavirus patients. 

He was the 13th doctor to succumb to Coronavirus. 

His unfortunate demise, however, brought into sharp focus the horrible treatment that some health workers have undergone while caring for patients. 

At Machakos County Hospital, a 28-year-old Dr Mogusu was caring for Coronavirus patients, many times without basic protective equipment. He had worked for five months, and had barely 30 days left on his contract. 

Just a few hours before the virus claimed his life on December 9, Dr Mogusu warned his colleagues in a Whatsapp group to push for their pay or get out of the profession with their health intact, while they still can. 

The health worker had not been paid for five months. He could not afford to buy diapers for his five-month-old daughter. Gire Ali 

A few days after the government banned all flights from China to curb the spread of Coronavirus, Kenya Airways security officer spotted a Southern Airlines plane landing at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. 

The direct flight from Guangzhou was ferrying 239 passengers into Kenya on February 26 and Mr Ali caught the touchdown on camera, before sharing it.

}




Transport CS James Macharia was angry, and branded Mr Ali a criminal for filming a security installation. 

But Kenyans, including Members of Parliament, differed, insisting that Mr Ali is a hero.

His employer suspended him, and Mr Gire started receiving death threats via mobile phone. 

Public outrage and pressure from lawmakers saw Kenya Airways reinstate Mr Gire. 

The High Court issued orders barring the Director of Public Prosecutions from pursuing him in court, and police undertook not to arrest the whistleblower. Michael Olunga 

For the last eight years, Michael Olunga’s star has been rising, and he is now one of the top rated “little-known” strikers that starred in 2020 as per the world governing body, FIFA. 

He is only the third African to top the scoring charts in Japan’s top flight.

Only Cameroon’s Patrick Mboma (25 goals for Gamba Osaka in 1999) and Nigeria’s Peter Utaka (19 goals for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in 2016) have achieved the fete.

“Engineer” Olunga is the first African footballer to bag the most valuable player award in Japan’s J-League history. 

Mr Olunga scored 28 league goals in 32 games, leading newly promoted Kashiwa Reysol to seventh place in the J-League this year. 

The striker has previously played for Liberty Academy, Tusker FC, Gor Mahia, Djugardens (Sweden), Guizhou Zhicheng (China) and Girona (Spain, on loan).

Peres Jepchirchir 

Peres Jepchirchir set two women-only world records, highlighted by her run of one hour, five minutes and six seconds in winning gold for Kenya at the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships in Gdynia, Poland, in October. 

Jepchirchir, the 2016 winner, regained her world title in a dramatic race that saw defending champion Netsanet Gudeta and world record-holder Yeshaneh both fall by the wayside.

On December 6, Jepchirchir stepped up from the half marathon to the full marathon, winning the Valencia Marathon in 2:17:16 to move to seventh on the world all-time list.  

Superb performances given that 2020 saw virtually all athletics competitions cancelled and athletes having to train minimally while observing Covid-19 protocols. 

Health CS Mutahi Kagwe 

Ever since Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe announced Kenya’s first Coronavirus case on March 13, the bureaucrat has ensured Kenyans get daily updates on the pandemic. 

He was exactly two weeks into the job when Kenya confirmed its first Coronavirus case. 

Only in September did Mr Kagwe start delegating the duty to juniors. He only comes in when he has a big announcement to make 

Mr Kagwe’s animated and emotional communication panache in daily briefings, coupled with his leadership style have given Kenyans hope in the face of the pandemic.

“His traits became assets,” one publication said of him. 

Whenever he took to the podium to give the briefings, Mr Kagwe would hilariously persuade Kenyans using all manner of messaging, including songs. 






With this he was listed by the Wall Street Journal among effective leaders globally during the coronavirus pandemic, the only leader in Africa. Health Director General Patrick Amoth 

The man behind the curtain. The engine that allows a car to run. 

Dr Patrick Amoth handles all technical issues at the Ministry of Health. 

His engagement with Kenyans through Twitter have earned him public endearment, as he answers any questions fired his way. 

Dr Amoth co-chairs the National Emergency Response Committee on Coronavirus that deliberate, projects numbers and advises President Uhuru Kenyatta on the way forward. 

He was among Kenyans who were awarded the Presidential Order of Service Award, Uzalendo Award, for his contribution in the fight against Coronavirus. 

And it was not just Kenyans that noticed his hard work. On May 23, the World Health Organisation appointed Dr Amoth to its executive board as vice chairman. 

At the WHO, Dr Amoth advises and gives effect to the decisions and policies of the World Health Assembly by facilitating the smooth running of the Assembly. He leads 34 peers from different countries.

Ms Electine Chausiku Wanyama 

For six years, Ms Electine Chausiku Wanyama has been taking care of vulnerable children living with cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus. 

The former volunteer teacher in a disability center in South Korea visualised starting a similar project in Kenya. 

In 2016, she started Precious Virginia Home. 

The centre is named after her daughter, who died in 2015. The home started in a rented house, but now occupies land donated by Kakamega County. 

The home is at Lairi village in Matungu, along the Mumias-Busia road. 

Ms Wanyama mobilises children living with severe cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus into the home where they can be easily assisted. 

She has also created support groups of parents and guardians where they share experiences and generate resources. 

A single mother of five, Ms Wanyama has no source of income and relies on well-wishers. 

The Home currently houses 35 children from Busia, Bungoma, Vihiga and Kakamega counties.

Ms Amina Abdalla 

Over a decade ago, Ms Abdalla started rescuing mentally ill patients from the streets. 

She feeds, clothes and rehabilites them before reuniting them with their parents. 

But when Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, she decided to start an isolation centre specifically for the mentally ill patients. 



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-8");
});
}




Since May, Ms Abdhalla has rescued over 100 mentally ill patients from various streets in Mombasa and had them tested for Coronavirus. 

Those that tested positive were isolated and cared for before being reunited with their families. 

Not even pressure from some Shanzu residents to close the isolation centre put Ms Abdalla down. 

Ms Abdalla efforts in June got commendation from the Health ministry for making Mombasa the only county to ensure that mentally ill individuals get access to Coronavirus management. 

With around 10 staff including her children and some health workers who volunteered in the initiative, Ms Abdhalla is among Kenya’s heroes. 

Chief Justice David Maraga 

Ever since Justice Maraga rose to the highest echelons of the Judiciary in 2016, the institution has had constant fights with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. 

But Kenya’s second Chief Justice under the 2010 Constitution stood his ground. 

The biggest battle this year, and which completely erased any chance of a Judiciary-Executive handshake, revolved around the appointment of 41 judges to various courts countrywide. 

While President Kenyatta insisted that some of the nominees had been flagged by intelligence agencies, Justice Maraga dared the Executive head to table evidence of misconduct.

Even when President Kenyatta’s administration slashed the Judiciary’s budget, Justice Maraga did not budge. 

Justice Maraga and President Kenyatta have snubbed many each other’s events, and the former’s last State of the Judiciary address was no different. 

In his farewell speech, Justice Maraga insisted that he holds no grudges against President Kenyatta despite the incessant fights between the two. 

The Chief Justice is on terminal leave pending retirement on January 12, 2021.

Jane Kimiti 

Othaya Girls School Principal Ms Jane Kimiti loves integrating information technology in the education process. She also fights hard for girl-child empowerment. 

Her efforts may not have caught the attention of many outside stakeholders at the learning institution. 

But they were more than enough to convince the African Union to award her its continental teacher of the year award for 2020. 

Ms Kimiti is the third Kenyan teacher to get global recognition in three years for going above and beyond to improve the education experience for learners. 

Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School teacher Peter Tabichi was awarded the coveted Global Teacher Prize in 2019. 

In the same year Asumbi Girls mathematics teacher Erick Ademba was awarded the Continental Teacher Prize. Sisters caution politicians against using their brother’s death to push their selfish interests. Healthcare workers have had no option but to fund-raise for their infected colleagues. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years. The footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020.
