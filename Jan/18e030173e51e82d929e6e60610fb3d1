Sonko should be made to pay for his confessed crimes 
MYLES LEO
Kenya has its problems. And they are many.
But the biggest economy in the East African region finds a way for her citizens and visitors to relieve their stress, comically. The country’s political scene is a comedy theatre. One of the main actors in the comedy is Gideon Kioko Mbuvi Sonko.

Sonko is a self-declared convict who engineered a prison break at some point, got into some not so legal business before he “reformed” and sought a political leadership office. In 12 years, Sonko was elected Makadara MP, the capital’s senator and governor.
A combination of natural and man-made factors have, however, somehow connived to remove him from office.
At one point when he was the city county’s boss Mike Sonko recorded a video of himself as he chewed khat, listened and danced to some rhumba music and listened to the problems of his subjects in his office and shared the video live on social media. When he was senator, Sonko travelled to the Hague in the Netherlands and led a demonstration against an International Criminal Court case against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.





However, it ceases to be funny when the governor of the country’s topmost county starts alluding to matters life and death. It is not funny when he declares he was part of a plot to destroy private and public property and it becomes tragic when he says he was privy to schemes that lead to the death of a minister and his deputy in what was thought to be an accident not so long ago.
Just the other day, he stood on a public forum and hurled verbal abuse to the Head of State. President Uhuru Kenyatta, being the wise man he is, ignored him.

But Sonko did not stop.
Speaking in Dagoretti South last Sunday, Sonko claimed he and Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho were involved in burning of vehicles, to paint ODM in bad light during the 2017 electoral period.
 “We are now seeing the deep state burning cars to paint hustlers in bad light. I want to confess and say this; in 2017 when ODM was holding demonstrations in Nairobi, Kibicho, I and other members of the deep state printed ODM T-shirts and bought old second hand vehicles and burnt then along Ngong road to make it appear like the party was behind the move,” Sonko told a cheering crowd at an event.
PS Kibicho refuted the claims by Sonko. And now the PS is breathing fire.
Sonko has also claimed that his life and that of the Deputy President William Ruto are in danger because of their political standing.
It is time the country stopped playing games with national security. Because Sonko is adamant that he has evidence to support his claims, he must be compelled to provide them now. The allegations he is making are too grave to be dismissed.
Having confessed that he was involved in a criminal act, the former governor should be made ‘to help police with investigations” even before Mr Kibicho and company file their own complaints.
