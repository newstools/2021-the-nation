Business came to standstill in Machakos town on Tuesday as rival candidates launched their campaigns for the senatorial by-election after they were cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
Three of the 10 candidates, Mutua Katuku (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Urbanus Ngengele (UDA) and Agnes Kavindu (Wiper) turned the presentation of nomination papers into a popularity contest.

Seen as the front runners in the hotly contested mini poll occasioned by the death of Senator Boniface Kabaka, the three faced off as they pulled huge crowds of supporters and long convoys of vehicles to escort them to IEBC’s county offices.
In an apparent show of political might, the candidates were each escorted by dozens of buses, trucks, cars and hundreds of bodabodas ferrying their supporters waving campaign caps and miniature flags.





The campaign teams staged peaceful road shows along Machakos town streets and addressed separate rallies, each exuding confidence that they will emerge victorious in the March 18 by-election.
The day climaxed with an emotional exchange between former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama and his estranged wife Agnes Kavindu–the Wiper candidate, who tore into each other over their bitter divorce that is likely to dominate the campaigns.
Mr Muthama publicly denounced his ex-wife at a rally at the Machakos Bus Park saying she doesn’t merit to represent Machakos County at the Senate. He was accompanied by several MPs and senators affiliated to Tangatanga wing of Jubilee party.
Referring her as “that other candidate”, Mr Muthama said his former spouse is the least qualified in the race and will perform poorly in debates and representation if elected to the Senate, prompting an immediate hard tackle from her.

“Wiper picked a person who cannot match the kind of wit and courage required to fight for the interests of Machakos people. She will even struggle to catch the Speaker’s attention during debates” said the former senator.
Mr Muthama, the interim chairman of the new party United Democratic Alliance associated with Deputy President William Ruto, urged voters to elect his candidate as he began the crusade against his ex-wife.
Barely an hour later, Kavindu responded angrily telling off her ex-husband over his remarks, and demanding that he respects her as the mother of his children.
She revisited her marital woes saying she has suffered immensely after their messy divorce, but insisted she deserves a second chance in life and the right to pursue her political ambitions.
“What should a woman do after being thrown out of her matrimonial home by her husband? Is one supposed to just die after divorce?” she posed to the cheering crowd while struggling to fight back tears during an emotional speech at Mulu Mutisya Gardens.
She urged Muthama to restrain from personal attacks by avoiding making their divorce a campaign issue and accord her an equal measure of respect.





Kavindu, who was picked by President Uhuru Kenyatta as a member of the defunct Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) taskforce, sought to insulate her ex-husband from being attacked by her campaigners saying she still respects him as the father of her children.

“Have you heard me insult my ex-husband anywhere since we separated? I can’t do that because I respect him as the father of my children and I ask you all to respect him, and keep our marital issues out of this campaign” she said amid cheers.
She was escorted to the IEBC offices by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula, Kanu chairman and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and several Wiper MPs.
Earlier in the day, Mr John Mutua Katuku, a former minister in the Kibaki regime who also served for two terms as the MP for Mwala constituency, addressed a similar crowds at Mulu Mutisya gardens, then proceeded to Masii, Wamunyu, Kithimani and Matuu markets, after he was cleared by IEBC.
Mr Katuku was accompanied by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, his deputy Francis Maliti, Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo and former Machakos Women Rep Dr Susan Musyoka and dozens of MCAs on the campaign trail.
The by-election is shaping into a three-horse race pitting Katuku, Kavindu and Ngengele but IEBC has cleared seven other candidates. Parties scramble to pick their best bets as disgruntled Ruto’s allies rejoin contest. Katuku is vying for the county’s senate seat on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket. DP Ruto accused of coming up with new pledges without fulfilling earlier promises. A spot check by Nation on Tuesday found no signs of the cross slab. BBI Bill to be tabled in all the counties after IEBC verified 1.14 million signatures.
