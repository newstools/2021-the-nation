Kenya Pipeline, who finished third during the 2019 KVF season, will launch their title campaign against league returnees Nairobi Water on January 23, before they take on newcomers Nairobi Prisons in another tie on the same day.Kenya Prisons defended the women's title as KCB Women's Volleyball Team finished second. Pipeline will play their home matches at Kenya Pipeline grounds as KVF strives to ensure the league matches are played indoors. "It feels good to be back."
Those were the humble words of national women's volleyball team and Kenya Pipeline middle blocker Triza Atuka as she resumed training after a lengthy injury layoff at the Pipeline grounds in Embakasi on Monday.
Atuka's return to the courts is timely for Pipeline ahead of the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) National League that serves off on January 23.

Unlike previous seasons where the league matches were played in selective counties across the nation, the 2021 season will see teams host their homes league matches at their backyards as part of the Covid-19 protocols.
Atuka, who has since recovered from a knee injury that saw her miss last year's Olympic qualifiers in Yaounde, said she will take one day at time, but was quick to note that she will focus on helping her team reclaim the league title that Pipeline last won in 2017.





"I'm indebted to the National Olympic of Kenya (NOC-K) Strength and Conditioning specialist, Geoffrey Kimani who has walked me through my recovery. National team coach Paul Bitok has also been supportive with his encouragement which has kept me going.
"My employer, Kenya Pipeline, has taken care of me through my recovery, thanks to their medical cover and generally the team for giving me time to recover well.
"Like any other player who has recovered from any injury, it takes time to hit top form, and I'm not any different but I'm determined to go all the way and return where I was before injury happened.
"With the help of my team members and technical bench, I believe it will be a matter of time ," said Atuka, a former Mukumu Girls High school player.

Pipeline coach Paul Gitau said Atuka was the missing piece in his team's puzzle.
"It goes without saying that Atuka's presence is welcomed and her availability ahead of the season makes it even more interesting. We will not rush her, but as a coach and team, we are happy and glad she is back. She is not rusty and that makes it even easier for me in training," said Gitau.
Team captain Rose Magoi was over the moon, saying Atuka's return is timely.
"Atuka is a proper player and as a team we are excited to have her back and we can only hope for the best. I wish her well not only at the club level, but also in the forthcoming national team assignments," said Magoi.
