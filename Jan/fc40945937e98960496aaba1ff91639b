A total of 105 delegates participated in the primaries that were presided over by Ford Kenya elections director Khadija Mustapha.
The nominations that attracted only two candidates were held at the Kabuchai CDF hall in Musese.
Mr Majimbo, a businessman, thanked the delegates for the victory and promised to put the interests of Kabuchai people first.
“I want to thank Wanyonyi, who had given me a tough contest, for conceding defeat and promising to walk with me in clinching the seat,” he said Mr Wetang’ula said the nomination process signified the internal democracy within the party.





Mr Wetang’ula claimed Mr Majimbo has the support of senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, Bungoma woman rep Catherine Wambilianga and all party MPs and MCAs.
Politics relating to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) referendum drive and clan politics are likely to feature strongly in the March 4 by-election.

Kabuchai, which was split from Sirisia constituency, is home to Mr Wetang’ula. The seat fell vacant following the death of Mr James Mukwei Lusweti, who was a close ally of Dr Ruto.
