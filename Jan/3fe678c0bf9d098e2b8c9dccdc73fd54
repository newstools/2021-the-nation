Shock and fear have gripped Ol Jabet Shopping centre in Laikipia County after a businessman was hacked to death by unknown people.
The businessman identified as Mr Patrick Maina is the latest casualty following a spate of attacks in the area in the past few months.
Residents found his body by a road on Saturday morning, covered in blood and with deep cuts in the head and back.

Maina was reportedly attacked while heading home from his shop at the shopping centre.
Led by Senator John Kinyua, the people held protests and demanded heightened security, citing the recent attack of a man they said was nursing serious injuries at Nyahururu County Referral Hospital.
They said the man went through a similar ordeal.
“The businessman is well known in this area. Residents are yet to come to terms with the murder,”  Mr Kinyua said on Saturday.

Mr Daniel Gachanja, who chairs the business community in the area, noted that the population has increased but the number of police officers at a nearby station remains small.
Marmanet Assistant Commissioner Philip Chesa said investigations will establish the motive for the attack.
“We have launched an investigation and will ensure the killers are brought to book,” said Mr Chesa.
He urged residents to always volunteer information that can help arrest criminals.
The body was taken to the Nyahururu County Referral Hospital mortuary.
