Ugandans are headed to the ballot amidst an internet shutdown and after months of a turbulent campaign period. The voters will decide either to extend the rein of President Yoweri Museveni to a sixth term, or vote in pop-star-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine.Museveni, the 76-year old president who has been at the helm for over 30 years, hopes to use the election, and a possible win, to cement his legacy as one of the country’s longest serving rulers.Wine, on the other hand, is banking on Uganda's youthful population to defeat Museveni in the polls amidst a growing crackdown by the police. There are 10 men and one woman in the race for the most coveted office in the country. Senate Majority Chief Whip fails to show up at an organised press conference at the Jubilee Party headquarters.
