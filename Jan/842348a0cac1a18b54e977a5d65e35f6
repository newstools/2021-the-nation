She studied at the University College Dublin (UCD), the great academic rival of Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Sr Colombiere graduated First Class Honours, earning the rare Education degree that combined English and Mathematics as teaching subjects. She made her final profession in the Congregation of Loreto Sisters, also known as the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (IBVM) in 1946.
Once vowed to religious life and equipped academically, she set sail for Kenya and arrived in Mombasa in 1948.

Colomb is best known for her leadership and service at Loreto Convent School Limuru. The alumnae of that iconic institution include Sr Dr Marie-Therese Gacambi, first African Superior of the Assumption Sisters of Nairobi; Mrs Annette Kemoli, nurse and entrepreneur, Sr Rosalia Khamuli, founder of the Carmelite Convent in Kisii and Prof Wangari Maathai, Nobel Laureate. 
Colomb created a deep and lasting influence on both members of staff and students. She carried herself with dignity and inspired her students to aspire for the same. Her authority was felt, without being authoritarian.
On account of her strong personality and effective leadership, the students nicknamed her “the Chief”, often pronounced “chifu” or “cibu” by the Loreto Limuru alumnae or “old girls” who call themselves Kotetians.
Though a strict disciplinarian, Colomb was glad to teach her students traditional Irish dance for enjoyment. During her 100th birthday celebrations, the Kotetians, delighted guests with a performance of the Irish step dance led by Sr Edel Bahati.
