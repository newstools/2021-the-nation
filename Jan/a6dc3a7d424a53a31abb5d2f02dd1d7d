Former Othaya MP Mary Wambui is the new chair of trustees of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund.
She takes over from former Marakwet East MP Linah Jebii Kilimo. Ms Wambui will serve for three years.
Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui made the changes on Friday in a gazette notice.  
Ms Wambui’s appointment as the National Employment Authority (NEA) board chair, under the same ministry, was revoked effective January 1, 2021.

Serve for three years
She was replaced at NEA by Prof Grace Jerotich Chesebek, who will also serve for three years, until January 2023.
In January last year, the Employment Court quashed the appointment of Ms Wambui as the chairperson of the NEA.
The court said her appointment was irregular as she did not meet the qualifications of the office.
Justice Onesmus Makau issued a permanent injunction, barring Ms Wambui from being appointed to the post.

Her appointment had been challenged in court by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, who sponsored the National Employment Bill in Parliament.
Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund, her new job, is mandated to coordinate rehabilitation activities for street families, conduct public education on street families issues as well as mobilise resources, fundraising and receive donations and funding street families rehabilitation programmes.
The Fund is also required to manage donations for the rehabilitation of street families through a trust fund, monitor expenditure and disbursement of donations and advise the government and other relevant agencies on matters relating to rehabilitation of street families. Pensions are supposed to be about reasonable pre-retirement income replacement. National Treasury CS has said the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out sources of revenue. Politicians led by Johnson Muthama, Susan Kihika and Kipchumba Murkomen say they have found peace and equality. The investigations have been narrowed down to close family members as well as the extended family.
