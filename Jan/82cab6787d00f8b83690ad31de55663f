Research has shown, students acquire literacy most efficiently in their native language.An education system that overly glorifies a foreign language is fated to fail. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 recognises Kiswahili as the national language at Article 7. It also recognises it, besides English, as an official language.
It tasks the state with the responsibility of promoting and protecting the diversity of language of the people of Kenya and promoting the development and use of indigenous languages, including in instruction.

In a paper published in February 2017, an educational policy researcher recommended that educational reforms should pay attention to the crucial question of the language of instruction and implementation of language policy in education.
Mother tongue holds a strong footing in the society since it is used for informal communication and neighbourhood conversations. While the opinion is always divided among parents, teachers, scholars and other stakeholders in the education sector on the use of mother tongue for instruction, a research published in 2013 showed that when used as a mode of instruction in school, it improved the quality of education; eliminated unnecessary dropouts.





The current socio-linguistic situation seems to have given English an undue hegemonic advantage over other languages. Mostly in sciences, it has dominated the instruction in lieu of an alternative system in which students could be actively engaged and learn using their native tongue. Couldn’t this lead to defaming and degrading mother tongues in the longer term? 
Academic achievement
Usually, those who oppose the idea of “ethnolinguistic diversity” in colleges cite huge costs associated with changing language of instruction, the large investments needed for intellectualisation of the language, and production of instructional and supplemental materials in mother tongue.

To them, it would cause confusion; that lack of direct translations of core scientific and mathematic terms may result in a language barrier, preventing students from excelling. One interlocutor confided in me that it may even exacerbate socio-ethnic stigmatisation.
However, methinks that the omission of mother tongue, especially in colleges, could adversely fuel marginalisation of monolingual mother tongue speaking prospective students and even teachers who do not have a solid grasp of English.
The totalitarian use of English as a means for students to acquire literacy is a practice that could lead to an ineffective educational system in the longer term or unnecessarily hamper academic achievement. 
As research has shown, students acquire literacy most efficiently in their native language. The more highly developed the first language skills, the better the results could be in the second language, because language and cognition in the second build on the first.
Some studies have even looked at it from the angle of economics. Maintaining English as the sole language of instruction in sciences has been shown to be a handicap on the economy since it results in low educational participation. There’s a correlation between weak economic development and low educational participation.

An education system that overly glorifies a foreign language — in the process leaving a major section of the society behind — is fated to fail.
