Speaking while unveiling candidates to fly the UDA flag in various by-elections, politicians in the movement described the party as a breath of fresh air as “terror and humiliation” were meted out in the ruling Jubilee Party.
They dared Jubilee leaders to kick them out for supporting an affiliate party. The party was rebranded from the People’s Democratic Party (PDR). 
“For those who have legal concerns, we as Jubilee members are supporting a party that was in a coalition with us in the last election. The Senate deputy majority leader is a UDA-elected member, for example,” Senator Murkomen said.





The former Senate majority leader, who was stripped of the position alongside many others for their affiliation with Deputy President William Ruto explained that since “the Jubilee room was locked”, they sought refuge in UDA, which is “another room in the same house, with President Uhuru Kenyatta as the father”.
“In our father's house there are many rooms. We have just moved to the brighter, renovated, welcoming room that is UDA,” Mr Murkomen said at the event that about 40 members of Parliament attended.
All equal
The sentiments were echoed by Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah and Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, who said they found peace and solace in the new outfit.

Ms Kihika dared Jubilee to discipline them over their stance, saying the party should begin by cracking the whip on members who campaigned for Orange Democratic Movement during the Kibera and Msambweni by-elections.
She said UDA has a national outlook and is friendly to all, unlike Jubilee, where she said there is segregation.
Mr Ichung’wah said, “To those who declared us persona non grata in Jubilee ... we are happier in our new home - the wheelbarrow movement that makes all Kenyans equal. With wheelbarrows, we shall rescue the sinking economy of this country.”
Mr Muthama said they are not asking members to quit Jubilee but to form a friendship with UDA.
“President Kenyatta leads Jubilee with William as his deputy. We are not telling anybody to leave Jubilee but to start associating us with us because this is the winning camp come 2022. If you stay away, you will [face] problems,” he said.
Leaders present included Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, former Kakamega Senator Boniface Khalwale,  Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri, South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro and Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali.
