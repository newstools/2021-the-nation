He clarified that AK will revert to normal distances in the second and third legs as well as the national trials for 2021 World Relay Championships set for Silesia, Poland from May 1 to 2.
In the race that attracted 17 runners, Kipsang took the lead in the last bend to win the race in four minutes and two seconds. His compatriots Tony Kemboi and Elias Ngeny clocked 4:04.5 and 4:04.7 respectively.





"Winning today (Saturday) is a good way of starting the series, because the race was not easy. I believe if I continue working hard, I will perform better in the upcoming competitions,” said Kipsang.
But the women’s category was less competitive, as only three runners battled it out.
Nancy Sang of KDF won in 5:34 after leading from start to finish. She beat Kenya Police's Jackline Cherono and Margaret Nduta who timed 6:20 and 6:26 respectively. "I am happy with the win but this is just the start. I still have to work hard to perform well in the other remaining legs,” she said.

It was a tough battle in the men’s 1000m (800m), with Noah Kibet beating Cornelius Tuwei by three seconds. Kibet triumphed in 2:20.03 while Tuwei timed 2:20.06. Nicholas Kiplagat came third in 2:21.04.
In the women’s category, which only attracted seven competitors, Vivian Chebet won in 2:46.7, ahead of Judy Jepkoech and Penina Wangari who finished in 2:48.3 and 2:49.4 respectively.

The men’s 150m (100m) had the highest number of competitors, forcing the organisers to stage eight heats. National Champion Mark Otieno emerged the overall winner in 15.5 seconds, leaving Zabloan Ekwan and Gilbert Osure to settle for second and third positions in 15.8 and 16.0 seconds respectively.
Kenya Prison’s Doreen’s Waka emerged first in women’s 150m that had three heats in 18.4 seconds. Kenya Police’s Monica Safania finished second in 18.7 seconds while Joy Akinyi was third in 18.9 seconds.

With more Kenyan athletes still getting banned for doping offences, Mutwii reiterated the dire consequences that await those who will be found guilty moving forward.
This follows the signing into law the Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "If you are caught now it will not just be a ban only, but you will also face the courts," he said.
The second and third legs will take place on January 23 and February 6 respectively before the national trials on March 3 at the same venue.
