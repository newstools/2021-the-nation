Odibets, one of Kenya's leading betting firms, has revamped its app. Betting fanatics are in for some goodies as 2021 begins.
The betting app that received great reviews from the public after it was launched in 2020 has now been made simpler and easier to use, on top of the welcome bonus one gets upon downloading it.
Odibets Country Marketing Manager Aggrey Sayi has stated that the new app is a way of appreciating punters who have been using it since its launch. "We have now made the app easy for punters to use. It will be a very simple process to place bets," he says, adding: "This year, we will be bigger as we strive to give our customers the best betting experience."
To install the app, one has to click on the Odibets App link and then follow the instructions.
The Odibets app has features like streaming live games, sharing bet slips, light and dark mode options and four virtual leagues that will keep punters on toes.
The sports betting app also pushes instant notifications on games. Punters place their bets and follow up on them.
To top it all, one gets a Ksh50 bonus for the first cash bet of Ksh30 and above on the app.
Early December 2020, Odibets partnered with Safaricom to enable punters to deposit on their accounts using the latter’s ‘Bonga Points’ facility. The feature, christened "Bet Bila Bundles", enables betting fanatics to place their bets using ‘Bonga Points’ whenever they are out of cash. Senior specialists among those affected.
