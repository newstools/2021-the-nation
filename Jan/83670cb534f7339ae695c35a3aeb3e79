During a tour of Narok County, the DP asked Mr Odinga, "When did you start realising that the same Jubilee you are in is not doing enough for Kenyans?”
He defended his position as Deputy President, saying it is his duty to speak up for the party, which has been severely criticised over unfulfilled promises to the people since taking over power in 2013.
"The Jubilee track record speaks for itself. Raila should show what he did during his time in government and in the opposition,"  he said.

Achievements in Narok
The DP spoke during a fundraiser in aid of 22 Churches at Ntulele in Kilgoris Constituency.
He said the jubilee government has constructed the 84-kilometer Narok-Mara road, Bomet-Emurua Dikirr road, Kilgoris-Esoit-Murkan road and many others.
"We have also done rural electrification. In Narok, 76,000 people have been connected to the national grid," he said.
The DP further noted that the government has also constructed five technical training colleges in Narok.
"We have built colleges so that we can accomplish the Big Four agenda,” he added.

‘Hustler’ tag
Dr Ruto also defended his ‘hustler’ tag, saying his mission is to benefit the poor by transforming the development agenda.
"I came from a humble background and I am now the DP. We should stop politics of hatred and insults since ‘hustlers’ also matter. We believe in God … everyone in the country should be respected,” he said.
He further asked Inspector-General Hillary Mutyambai to respect boda boda riders and stop branding them criminals.
Earlier this week, the IG warned boda boda riders against acts of violence and other crimes, especially at accident scenes.
Dr Ruto said, "Those who stole from Kemsa … are they boda boda riders? These people should stop insulting ‘hustlers’. The Covid-19 billionaires who stole from the government are prominent people.”
