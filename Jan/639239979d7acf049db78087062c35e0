After training in Kenya for weeks, the South African runner will on Sunday try to attain the Tokyo Olympics women’s marathon qualifying timeRanked second in South Africa, Bothma’s personal best time is at 2:33:35, which means she must slash four minutes and six seconds off this PB to qualify for the Tokyo OlympicsTold she would not live to reach 30 years, highly motivated South African athlete is now eyeing Olympic glory On October 11, 2019, Annie Bothma posted on Instagram: “This past weekend, I married my best friend. We didn’t have an official wedding. We signed the legal documentation and then met my family and a few close friends for lunch at the beautiful Kirstenbosch Gardens. 

“I didn’t want a fancy wedding dress -- I wanted to be able to look back at the pictures and feel like me -- free and always ready to run!”

Simplicity at its best.

Her groom must have heaved a huge sigh of relief as Bothma’s wedding outfit must have cost not more than $117.50 (or Sh12,000). 

“I felt confident wearing what I love and feel most comfortable in,” she said. 

Bothma places her running before all else and on Sunday, she will be on the road in a special time trial in South Africa, chasing the Olympic women’s marathon qualification time of two hours, 29 minutes and 30 seconds. 






Ranked second in South Africa, Bothma’s personal best time is at 2:33:35, which means she must slash four minutes and six seconds off this PB to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.

But she feels motivated, having endured a lot of pain and sacrifice in training, coupled with overcoming life-threatening illnesses that prompted doctors – when she was a little girl -- to warn her she won’t get to 30 years. 

She feels motivated because for the past few months, the 26-year-old Stellenbosch runner has been training at Kapsait in Elgeyo Marakwet County. 

She is motivated because she has been training in the company of women’s world marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei.

She is motivated because she has been trained by one of Kenya’s finest coaches, Erick Kimaiyo, at the Kapsait camp founded by Kimaiyo in partnership with decorated Italian distance running coach Gabriele Rosa and his Rosa Associati stable. 

Nation Sport spent some time at the Kapsait camp this week and followed Bothma’s dedicated work ethic. 

Up daily before 5am, Bothma followed Kimaiyo’s punishing regime in the simple camp, with the morning runs taking the elite athletes to various destinations including Kapcherop and Iten in Elgeyo Marakwet and also Ziwa in Uasin Gishu County.

 On Sunday, Bothma will run in a solo time trial in 17 loops of 2.5 kilometres each, making up the 42-kilometre marathon distance. 

She hopes to dip under 2:29:30 and book her ticket to Tokyo, most probably making the journey back to Kapsait for the finishing touches. 

She reckons getting into the rhythm of things at the Kapsait camp was not easy due to the high altitude factor, and that she had difficulty in breathing.

The Kapsait camp rises to 3,000 metres above sea level. 

“I almost gave up, but our coach Eric Kimaiyo encouraged me to continue training. After two weeks I was feeling better and I started enjoying it with my performance improving each day,” said Bothma in an exclusive interview.

Born at sea level, the Capetonian has been training hard for the last 10 weeks at the high altitude Kapsait camp which she termed as “one of the best in the world.” 






“My training has been good and my goal is to get the qualification mark for the Olympics Games where I want to represent my country. There has been a lot of improvement on my performance since I came to Kapsait,” said Bothman.

When the coronavirus pandemic hit the world with all major sporting events cancelled, Bothma was devastated but went on training in the company of her father Christo Bothma. 

“I’m happy my father used to cycle behind me which was a good support because he knew what I want in my career,” she added. 

“When I first came to this place (Kapsait) it was really hard for me to train but after two weeks my body adapted and I was enjoying every bit of it. I have been to Iten and comparing the two places, I will vote for Kapsait because it has the best terrain and altitude. 

“Someone who has not been in the region cannot understand why we are voting for the place but when I came here, I knew why Brigid was able to break the world record time because it has the best conditions I have ever experienced,” she said.

Bothma feels motivated training with Kosgei who always motivates her to keep pushing.

“Training with Brigid is what gave me more energy because she always encourages me to go for the best. The good training, I have done is because she has really pushed me to work hard,” she added. 

“Training and taking rest to recover is what I have been able to enjoy. It was tough for me because I have been in and out of hospital and even at one time I had been told that I won’t make it to 30 years of age, but look at me I’m doing well and enjoying training!” 

Born in December 26, 1995, Bothma went to Elkestad Primary School before heading to Bloemhof Girls High School in South Africa, shifting to the USA to pursue studies in Exercise Science at Boise State University before transferring to Coastal Carolina in the second and third year. 

She also has a certificate in coaching and sport nutrition.

In 2013, Bothma was diagnosed with Celiac disease which triggers an allergic reaction upon the digestion of gluten.

}, 62000);
}




Later, in 2015, further diagnosis done by an endocrinologist revealed she had a rare disorder called Hypopituitarism which causes the pituitary gland situated at the base of the brain to fail in its production of hormones. 

But despite all the challenges she went through, Bothma managed to compete at university, winning the 5,000m indoors along with 5km (cross country) and 10,000m outdoors.

She won collegiate regional titles in the 10,000m and 6km in cross country in 2017. 

It is at the Sanlam Elite Invitational Marathon last year where she clocked her personal best marathon time of 2:33:35. 

Having won several road races back home in “Mzansi”, she maintains there is no short-cut in athletics. 

At Kapsait, she loves the fresh, organic vegetables and fruits, and sometimes does her own cooking as she is on a special diet given her medical conditions that, inter alia, prevents her from taking milk and wheat products.

“This means no chai and chapati for me…” she jokes. 

“I love fruits and the vegetables in Kenya and I have seen tremendous improvement on my health and I would always love to continue training here because it’s one of the best places in the world,” she explained. 

Coach Kimaiyo says Bothma has improved a lot since setting foot at his camp. 

“If she continues with the same pace, she will to do well in the sport,” said Kimaiyo.
