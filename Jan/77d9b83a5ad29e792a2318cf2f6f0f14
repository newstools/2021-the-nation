The High Court has opened the way for Nairobi County Assembly members to vet deputy governor nominee Anne Mwenda. 
The court on Friday threw out cases challenging the nomination of Ms Mwenda as deputy governor.  
The county assembly members started vetting Ms Mwenda on Friday morning at 9am and concluded shortly after 10am.

The process began after clerk Edward Gichana confirmed there is no court order stopping the vetting.
The 10-member committee led by Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo retreated to write a report that will be considered by the assembly at 11am. Sonko, in sworn affidavit, claims President Kenyatta's sister Christina Pratt attempted to influence appointment of his deputy. Ms Mwenda is set to be vetted on January 15, but Sonko says he revoked her nomination a day before he was impeached by MCAs. Ugandan opposition leader rejects early results which gave President Yoweri Museveni a wide lead as a "joke". This follows a swift confirmation process by ward representatives earlier in the day. Incumbent leader makes leap towards sealing stay in office beyond 35 years after he steadily stretched lead over ten other candidates eyeing country’s presidency.
