The 10 governors said Mr Kang’ata breached government protocols by using a “cheap, populist” method to address the President.They emphasised that the BBI is a national agenda, not a Mt Kenya issue. Ten governors from the Mt Kenya region have censured Senate Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kang’ata over his daring letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta over the status of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) drive in the region.
The county chiefs united under the Central Region Economic Bloc (Cereb) said Mr Kang’ata should have followed official government structures and procedures in his address to the President.

The Murang’a senator’s letter dated December 30, 2020, addressed to President Kenyatta and Jubilee Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, reveals the challenges the BBI faces in Mt Kenya.
“The BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya. For every 10 persons I surveyed, six oppose it, two support it and the other two are indifferent … if we do not take urgent measures, I will pin myself permanently in the pillar of the shame of the spectacular defeat,” he said.





In a statement on Monday, the Central Kenya governors said Mr Kang’ata breached government protocols by using a “cheap, populist” method to address the President.
“While we acknowledge some of the issues raised, we believe it is very premature to judge the Bill as it has just been published for public participation and intensive discussion at the grassroots,” they also said in the letter.
“It is at this level that the entire leadership will be expected to educate and sensitise wananchi, with elected leaders expected to play a key role in these public engagements, without fear of intimidation or coercion.”
The 10 governors are Cereb chair Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua), deputy chair Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga), James Nyoro (Kiambu), Martin Wambora (Embu), Nderitu Murithi (Laikipia), Mwangi wa Iria (Murang’a), Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi) and Mutahi Kahiga (Nyeri).

“Personal prejudice”
The group further pointed out that the people waiting for the published Bill and thus to “intimate that the Mt Kenya region is opposed to the document at this stage is not only preposterous but also a serious misrepresentation of facts and reality, and we repeat - very premature.”
“We can confirm that at no time did Hon Kang’ata seek or discuss any of the issues raised with any governor or key elected leader of the Mt Kenya Cereb region, who interact with wananchi at the grassroots on a day to day basis.”
“Hon Kang'ata statement should be deemed as personal and based on personal prejudice. The Central Kenya region has a unique political behaviour driven by unique interests, not hysterical emotions,” the statement read.
The county chiefs asserted that the BBI captures the interests of Cereb and the region.
“For example, in areas where counties did not get extra MPs, wananchi are still positive to the BBI because of increased resources to counties, the youth, women, people living with disabilities and agriculture, and cognition of key economic value chains across the country, such as livestock sugar, potatoes, tea, coffee, infrastructure, minerals and natural resources.”

Regarding a possibly bloated wage bill, they said they will recommend a ring-fenced version that will see the reduction of salaries and allowances.
National agenda
The group emphasised that the BBI is a national agenda, not a Mt Kenya issue, “just like ‘chief whip’ is a national office, not a regional office”.
“Statements by a national leader have far-reaching implications so we urge [them]s to stop issuing irresponsible statements or utterances that may cause despondency and fear,” the statement said.
“In this regard, we urge top Jubilee leaders to immediately call on all political actors - national, county and grassroots -  to [ensure] synergy in the national interest.”
ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said it is difficult to gauge the popularity of a proposal to amend the Constitution prior to proper civic education.
“What people know about the BBI is largely rumors and negative innuendo peddled by opponents of the process. After IEBC’s signature verification, civic education will begin in earnest and I'm sure once the positives are unpacked in a mwananchi-friendly manner, all the lies against the process will be laid bare. It is only at this point that one can measure truthfully whether the public is for or against the BBI,” Mr Sifuna said.

He added, “After those initially opposed to the process claimed their views were accommodated, you haven't seen them go to the ground to popularise the document with the same vigor with which they opposed it. Why is that? Even after claiming credit for the final document they are still badmouthing it. These are dishonest fellows.”
Analyst's deductions
Political risk analyst Dismas Mokua said Mr Kang'ata's move is unprecedented in Kenya’s political history in many ways.
“You cannot send a letter to the President and copy his juniors, and proceed to send copies to newsrooms. One smells a rat,” he said.
“The letter confirms what is in the public space - that Raila’s association with Jubilee has diluted his brand and he will end up carrying all Jubilee failures and mistakes. He is now associated with Jubilee’s poor monetary and fiscal policies.”





The letter, he added, confirms that due to social, anthropological and historical reasons, Central Kenya may have serious challenges voting for Mr Odinga, leader of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).
“Raila will need to move mountains and lakes to persuade the average Central Kenya voter to vote for him. The letter also confirms that Jubilee policies are a successful failure and that Central Kenya, a key cog in Jubilee, is open to new candidates outside Jubilee.”

}



He added that the letter shows Deputy President William Ruto may benefit from the discontent in the region, “but this will obviously change when other politicians like Musalia Mudavadi declare their interest in the presidency”.
“The current political and economic crisis is a Jubilee administration creation. More importantly, it could be part of a larger strategy to position President Kenyatta as a lame duck who has lost his political capital - that he has lost political capital not across the nation but right at home - his core.“
Push for ouster
Some BBI proponents pushed for Mr Kang’ata’s removal from his position, a post he got following the de-whipping of Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika for her anti-BBI sentiments and association with Deputy President William Ruto.
Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli, one of the champions of the drive, said had Mr Kang’ata been sincere, “he would have dealt with this matter without referring it to the press.”
“He would have done it through private consultation and I believe the President who supported him to take the seat (of Majority Chief Whip) would have given him a hearing,” Mr Atwoli said.
Nyeri Town MP Wambugu Ngunjiri and Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo said Mr Kang’ata is a liability to the Jubilee Party leadership.

“We saw how he wobbled the revenue share debate in Senate to an extent it took the President to step up and help solve it. Today – rather than work to solve any challenges with BBI he’s trying to cleanse himself of them publicly, by trying to throw the President under the bus. We need to accept we made a mistake with him,” said Mr Ngunjiri.





He added: “This shows how wrong we got it on this one while making leadership changes in Parliament as a party. This we will fix very soon.”
ODM Political Affairs director Opiyo Wandayi said it was inappropriate for the letter to be made public.
Jubilee Deputy Secretary-General Caleb Kositany celebrated Mr Kang’ata’s views.
“This is most welcome; I hope Hon Kang’ata is not in trouble,” he said.
Additional reporting by Gitonga Marete, George Munene and Alex Njeru Sources said the letter was written after consultation with leaders supporting Mr Kenyatta. Nyeri Town MP Mr Ngunjiri Wambugu said Mr Kang’ata was not sincere in his letter for sharing it with the media and the public. The court has suspended a Gazette notice calling for the Nairobi by-election following a case by impeached Governor Mike Sonko. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age.
