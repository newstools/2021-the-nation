Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo has confirmed that her UK counterpart’s visit is meant to reaffirm and promote that pact. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s current visit to Kenya should go a long way in reaffirming the two countries’ commitment to forging closer ties and co-operation despite the former’s exit from the European Union (EU). It should, indeed, calm any apprehension about the Brexit aftermath.

Kenya and Britain enjoy cordial relations that date back to the colonial period and enhanced through the Commonwealth, a grouping more of equal partners as independent states.
Mr Raab has come bearing some good news, indeed. He has delivered a shot in the arm of the programme for the construction of affordable housing for Kenyans, which is one of the pillars of President Kenyatta’s ‘Big Four Agenda’. The other Big Four pillars are food security, manufacturing and universal healthcare.





The United Kingdom has provided Sh8 billion as part of the funding for the construction of 100,000 affordable housing units for low-income earners. Also in the visiting minister’s bag of goodies is Sh7.2 billion for the mitigation of climate change effects.
Britain is also collaborating with Kenya in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and terrorism, both of which pose serious challenges that require substantive funds to stem.
After Brexit, Kenya and the UK now have a five-year strategic deal to continue co-operation in trade, the development of education and counter-terrorism. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo has confirmed that her UK counterpart’s visit is meant to reaffirm and promote that pact.

The relations with the UK and its former EU partners should be anchored in the pursuit of tangible benefits for Kenya. The officers who had tear gas confiscated the group's placards before protest activities began at Jeevanjee Gardens. The two properties were purchased through the funds suspected to be proceeds of crime and corruption.
