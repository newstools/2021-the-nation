Three police officers charged with aiding the escape of a Ugandan national accused of kidnapping and possibly killing a missing officer will know their fate in 60days.
The officers are from Kamukunji police station in Nairobi County.
Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Esther Kimilu on Monday postponed the case to February 22 on the request of lawyer William Arusei, who was reportedly indisposed.

Mr Arusei sent a junior lawyer from his firm to represent him.
Ms Kimilu was also informed that the case requires a single-day hearing as the witnesses are not many.
“The prosecution was ready to proceed with the trial. Five witnesses had been bonded and are in court,” a state prosecutor said.
Others accused
Mr Arusei is defending Corporal Vacity Chebet Kemeres who is charged alongside police constables c and Elias Koome Mungaria.





The three, who were released on bond, have denied helping Mr Martin Wasike to escape from Kamukunji on the night of May 13, 2020.
Mr Wasike had been detained at the station alongside Ugandan Sharif Wanabwa and Kenyan Phoebe Anido Andayi over the disappearance of Police Constable Abel Misati on January 19, 2020.
Phone found
Mr Wanabwa, Ms Wasike and Ms Andayi are indicted for kidnapping the 27-year-old police officer with the intention of killing him.
Following the disappearance of Mr Misati, who was attached to Kamukunji Police Station in Nairobi, investigators recovered his mobile phone in Eastleigh, Nairobi, on April 17.
The officers were arrested after lawyer Alfred Nyandieka intervened on behalf of the family, which had called for justice.
Mr Nyandieka protested the manner in which the case was being conducted, saying a “police officer who is well trained cannot disappear just like that”. He also said that the entire police force has been quiet and has not taken any steps to bring to book those behind the disappearance.

OCS summoned
Ms Kimilu has summoned the officer commanding Kamukunji police station to appear in court on January 17 to give an update on Mr Wasike’s whereabouts.
She also directed police to produce Mr Wanambwa and Ms Andayi in court for further directions to be issued.
Crime busters from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations narrowed down on the three officers after viewing CCTV footage.
When Mr Wanabwa appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi after the escape, he said Mr Wasike was called out of the cells but never returned.
Mr Wanabwa, Mr Wasike and Ms Andayi were charged after police found them with property suspected to have been stolen from the missing officer.
Mr Wasike disappeared from the police station a day after he was charged.
Mr Wanabwa and Mr Andayi have been denied bond.
