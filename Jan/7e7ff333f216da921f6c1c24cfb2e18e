Kirinyaga County is focusing its Covid-19 prevention campaigns on schools — which re-opened this week — in a bid to ensure there is no rise in the spread of the virus.

County Health Executive Gladys Kimingi said that in order to contain the spread of the virus, continuous sensitisation in schools as well as monitoring to ensure that the laid-down guidelines are followed will be carried out.
This will complement the campaigns that were carried out in schools following last term’s partial re-opening.
Ms Kimingi said that so far, about 200 teachers have been reached while students from about 60 schools have been sensitised in the past one month when the Department of Health embarked on accelerated Covid-19 prevention campaigns around the county.

She added that the county government has linked all the schools with health workers who will be in contact with them from time to time, offering the required guidance as well as ensuring that they follow the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health which include wearing of masks and washing of hands, among others.
Apart from sensitising teachers and students, roles of other staff in the schools such as watchmen, cooks and groundsmen have been spelt out so that they all play their part in the prevention of Covid-19 spread in the schools.
She stressed that the Health Department has also come up with a reporting template for Covid-19 suspected cases in schools which is supposed to be filled in by school heads and submitted to the sub-county Covid-19 multi-agency team through the sub-county public health officers. The template captures details of students, the symptoms exhibited and the facility they are referred to.

Ms Kimingi advised that any student suspected of having Covid-19 should be taken to the nearest health facility where he or she will be reviewed and referred accordingly should they meet the case definition for the disease.
On Wednesday, the county’s Department of Education held a sensitisation meeting for all principals of polytechnics, the early childhood development education (ECDE) sub-county education officers as well as sub-county and ward administrators from the county.
Extra classrooms
The officers were taken through the various guidelines and school re-opening directives which they were asked to implement.
Kirinyaga Education Executive Joseph Kinyua said that all the county’s 198 ECDE centres have already re-opened while the 15 polytechnics in the county will be re-opened next week. He noted that the polytechnic principals are members of the zonal Covid-19 committees.
Mr Kinyua also noted that the extra classrooms constructed last year in some ECDE centres and polytechnics will go a long way in enhancing the capacity of the institutions.
He said that during the last financial year, the county government built five ECDE classrooms and renovated 26 others while this year, several new classrooms will be built under a ward-based development programme.

});
}, 62000);

The county has also constructed an additional 20 classrooms and two dormitories to expand the capacity of the youth polytechnics in the last three years.
Mr Kinyua also said that pupils from ECDE centres will benefit from free face masks from a consignment of 140,000 masks set to be distributed by the county government to school children.
The masks are produced by the Department of Gender at the county’s Kaitheri Apparel Factory in Kerugoya.
He urged school staff, parents and pupils to play their part in preventing the spread of the virus, both while in school and outside.
