The boy turned on him with kicks and blows, causing Mr Gikonyo serious injuries on the mouth.In Bomet County, a Form Four student was arrested after he allegedly attacked and injured a fellow student with a panga. There is a disturbing wave of juvenile delinquency spreading across schools. Just three weeks into the new term, unprecedented cases of violent behaviour by students towards their teachers, other staff, and fellow students have been reported. 

At least five students have been charged with assault after allegedly attacking and injuring their teachers or schoolmates with knives, machetes and metal bars. In one extreme case, a schoolboy is staring at murder charges after being accused of killing a watchman.

In the shocking development that is now raising concerns among education stakeholders, property worth millions of shillings have been destroyed in fires suspected to have been started by students in eight schools. 

“It’s a very serious issue and a reflection of our societal failure,” Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said last week. 






On January 12, a Form Three student at Kisii School attacked two teachers with a knife, stabbing and critically injuring one of them and leaving the other with a cut on the cheek. He was charged with attempted murder in a Kisii court the following day. 

The minor denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh50,000. On the day he appeared before court, another student at Mokwerero Secondary School in Nyamira County was seized by teachers while in possession of a machete and a file. He had allegedly planned to attack the deputy principal with the weapon. 

Meanwhile, an 18-year-old Form Three student linked to the death of a school guard at Nyang’ori Boys High School in Vihiga County is staring at murder charges. He appeared in court but did not plead to the charges after the police asked for seven days to continue holding him until mental assessment results are out.

Attempted murder 

On Monday last week, police in Kisii County arrested a Grade Four pupil of Kegati Primary School and her boyfriend, a Form Four student, over attempted murder. The 14-year-old girl is said to have tried to poison her father after he questioned their affair. 

“Her father queried her about the affair on Saturday but she was not happy about it. On Sunday morning, when others left for church, she was left at home with the father. She prepared porridge, put poison in it and served him,” said the area chief, Mr Alexander Nyakenywa. 

Her father only survived after he detected the foul smell of Diazinon, a pesticide, before he could take it. 

In another case, a 20-year-old Form Three student at Murichu Secondary School in Nyandarua County on Tuesday last week pleaded guilty to assaulting his teacher, causing a disturbance at school and damaging property when he appeared before Nyahururu Senior Resident Magistrate James Wanyanga. The teacher, Mr James Gikonyo, had reprimanded the student for not queuing as they were being served lunch. The boy turned on him with kicks and blows, causing Mr Gikonyo serious injuries on the mouth. He will be sentenced on February 12.

County director of education Mbaka Gitonga further disclosed that students at Kuinet Secondary School went on a go-slow early this month to protest alleged harassment by the administration on Covi-19 regulations.
