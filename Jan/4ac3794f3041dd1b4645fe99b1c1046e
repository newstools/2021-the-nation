Two people have escaped death narrowly after a bus belonging to Pollman Tours and Safari Company plunged into the Indian Ocean at the Likoni channel.
The bus slid into the ocean while embarking on MV Jambo ferry at around 10.30am Sunday on the mainland side of the channel.
The driver, Salim Omar, and his conductor, John Omutere, were rescued by officers from the Kenya Ferry Services (KFS) and the Kenya Coast Guard Service (KCGS).

The two agencies were assisted by local divers who normally hang out at the channel.
The Yutong luxury bus was coming from Diani where it had dropped tourists who had arrived at the Mombasa airport on Saturday.
Another bus belonging to the same company, however, managed to enter into the ferry safely.

Slippery ramp
Mr Omar said he lost control because of the slippery ramp.





The slippery surface was occasioned by rains that pounded the area on Sunday morning.
"I lost control as I was almost getting into the ferry. The ramp is very slippery. I just thank God we are alive," said Mr Omar, who was visibly shaken by the incident.

He said he has crossed the Likoni channel while driving for the last 11 years but has never experienced such an incident.
Mr Omutere said he helped the driver out of the bus before he was also helped out by the KFS officials and the local divers.
"We are lucky we managed to get out before the bus was entirely submerged. We have survived," he said. KFS says MV Safari is undergoing repairs after colliding with MV Kwale on Tuesday.
