A monumentally corrupt, monstrously violent totalitarian state always consolidates itself to preside over corruption.In times of unbearable suffering by the vast majority of the people, expect government functionaries to be completely out of touch. The Covid-19 pandemic is utterly ruthless. Humans have always been vulnerable to viruses. But this particular mutant has also exposed the abject vulnerability of human institutions, including the state.
A lot of the power and efficacy that states and governments have always claimed and projected have been exposed as nothing more than woeful sham. Beyond pomp and ceremony, parades and displays, formalities and protocols, the African state in particular has been shown to be all hat.

A nagging feeling that ordinary people were long forgotten by their servants in postcolonial government has persisted for decades. However, there has always been someone to blame: foreign governments and their diabolical geopolitical machinations, multilateral institutions and their harebrained experiments, oppositionists and their treasonous agenda and the civil society on behalf of the neocolonial establishment.





But the African state incrementally milked, sucked and bled all sovereign power out of citizens, becoming autocratic and repressive in the name of protecting our freedom.
Every possible problem attracted violent responses through escalating police power. Surveillance, abduction and disappearance, torture and murder and, finally, imprisonment became normalised state responses to demands for services, explanation or accountability in the face of existential angst.
A monumentally corrupt, monstrously violent totalitarian state always consolidates itself to preside over corruption and repression in times of desperate citizen suffering. Obviously, this divides society into starkly opposed constituencies, with the state’s privileged surrogates living off the fat of the land, whilst the teeming mass of the Great Unwashed shiver in the sweltering fever of destitution.

Always, without fail, arrogant potentates make it their life’s purpose to strut and gloat, boastfully humiliating their victims with gratuitous insults.
In the independence years, a highly educated cosmopolitan endorsed Kenya’s ruthlessly exploitative and corrupt leadership, saying that a man-eat-man society is definitely better than a man-eat-nothing one. Shortly afterwards, a less refined colleague demanded the immediate detention of Karl Marx for misleading students to agitate for democracy.
In later years, surmising that protesting students loudly demanding dialogue were actually crying for chapati, another illustrious leader directed that the students must enjoy enough “dialogue” at all meal times. In turn, appreciative students were thenceforth expected to return to lecture halls, gladly bereft of the execrable Bwana Marx.
A legacy of these terrible times is the absolute death of critical engagement, robust intellectual flourishing and literary expression in our institutions of learning. The other was the relentless association of intellectual activity with basic subsistence, a sort of substitution of chapatti for discourse.

Absurd days
One would hope that those deliriously absurd days are firmly behind us. One would be dismayingly wrong. In times of unbearable suffering by the vast majority of the people, expect government functionaries to be completely out of touch, insulting, reckless, utterly and unnecessarily thoughtless. That is the sign of the times.

Why are healthcare workers on strike, neglected, unappreciated and suffering unattended? Covid-19 pandemic’s official frontline combatants are not healthcare professionals, but the “securocracy”. 
The Ministry of Interior took charge of the situation and made the pandemic response a police affair, with the health bureaucracy reduced to incessant recital of barely meaningful statistics. 
Apart from co-ordinating development implementation, inspecting development projects and keeping contractors on toes, the Ministry of Interior is also eradicating gambling, ensuring that all learners are back in school on Monday and, one must infer, deploying orders to ensure that no coronavirus escapes the long arm of the law.
It also spearheads inter-ministerial committees and multiagency task forces to perform all sorts of transformational miracles.
Unsurprisingly, the most visible government activity today is essentially violent, with vulnerable citizens invariably on the receiving end.
Social distancing requirements of Covid-19 containment alone demand nearly threefold increment of school facilities. As matters stand, public schools have been dangerously overcrowded since government expanded transition without investing a single shilling in commensurate expansion of school infrastructure.

Ancient facilities are falling apart. Young Kenyans are penned in undignified, unsanitary and unsafe conditions. Schools are barely habitable, and there is yet no signal of meaningful government concern. 
Covid-19 demands extremely ambitious investment, which, clearly, is not forthcoming.
It is therefore perfectly in keeping with the temper of our time that Prof George Magoha would describe arrangements to learn under trees as innovative; the poor man is at his wits’ end. Any wonder then, that Wilson Sossion’s Knut is enduring a blistering revisiting?

The message of the Leviathan is elementary: you are on your own; keep quiet (wear a mask), and stay out of the way (social distance), or contend with teargas, rungus and nyahunyos. 
The government side perfectly equanimous; they are obscenely lavished with government largesse.
Nevertheless, happy new year!
Mr Ng’eno is an advocate of the High Court and a former State House speechwriter; @EricNgeno Cartels consume twice every year what legitimate county governments get in one year. We live at a time of tremendous burgeoning of ministerial clout. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years. The footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020. However they made us feel, the men and women in this list elicited different emotions in all of us.
