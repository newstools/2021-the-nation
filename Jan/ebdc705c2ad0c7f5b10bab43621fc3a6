Ms Eunice Amelia Liavure, 35, a daughter of Ms Nabwangu who was a pastor at the Mumbetsa Church of God was remanded in custody for 14 days after police made an application to be allowed to finalise investigations into the macabre killing of the cleric.
A postmortem examination conducted on Tuesday by the Kakamega Chief Pathologist Dr Dickson Mchana indicated that Ms Nabwangu was bludgeoned to death during the attack on the night of January 12, 2021. 
Dr Mchana said in his report that the deceased, appears to have been hit on the head with a blunt object before she collapsed and died. The blunt object used in the attack left an opening in the skull of the deceased, leading to hemorrhage in the brain.





At the burial, family members, led by Ms Sylvia Nabwangu, who is the daughter of deceased, said police need to conclude the investigations and have the suspects arraigned.
"We have many questions lingering in our minds but we have left everything to the investigating agencies to tell us who killed our mother and why,” the bereaved daughter said.
Loving and caring mother
She described her late mother as loving, caring and an intercessor who was cherished by the community.
"She was more than a mother because as a teacher, she remained strict and full of discipline. When our mother was the teacher on duty, would wake up very early, prepare one cup of tea for herself and sneak out of the house leaving us a sleep," said Sylvia.
