The Central Organization of Trade Unions (Cotu) has hit out at the government for introducing “unreasonable taxes”, saying it should not overburden the people.
In a statement on Friday, Cotu Secretary-General Francis Atwoli noted that Kenyans are suffering the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, whose first local case was reported in March 2020.

Mr Atwoli challenged the National Treasury to get creative and advise the Executive on alternative measures it can employ to sustain the economy.
“The Treasury must learn how to balance between providing services using the taxes and burdening the public in the collection process,” he said.
Many struggling
Mr Atwoli was reacting to the revelation that the government has hit salaried workers with hidden tax increases by revising tax bands, a move which will see those earning above Sh32,333 pay a maximum of 30 per cent in taxes.





He said Cotu is “totally opposed” to the decision and reminded the government that many Kenyan workers, like others globally, are struggling to put food on the table.
In the law enacted last week, Parliament also ended tax reliefs effected as a cushion against the effects of the pandemic.
Regarding this, the Cotu boss said reasons for which the incentives were given remain valid, and warned the government against provoking the public through punitive tax measures.
“By reversing these measures, are we saying we have conquered the pandemic? What has changed since April to convince the government that Kenyans are out of the woods and that these tax measures won’t be burdensome? What are the indicators the government is using?”

});
}, 62000);
}



Before the pandemic, the 30 per cent maximum tax rate was being charged on amounts above Sh74,000. The change to Sh32,333 will bring nearly half the population into the bracket.
“Unnecessary" projects
Mr Atwoli further said anybody earning below Sh100,000 must be cushioned.
“Those earning up to Sh100,000 and are on the verge of retirement need to be cushioned further by not being taxed.”
He further said the government must stop spending huge amounts of money on "unnecessary" projects that have no immediate benefit to the public.
“You cannot kill Kenyans while telling them you are building roads for them, because they need to be alive to use the roads. The government must, especially now, learn how to be less ambitious with some of its development projects.”
The umbrella trade union further asked the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to embark on proactive collection of taxes from Kenyans who have mastered the art of evading payment, saying it is “immoral” to overtax a population already hurting due to the pandemic.
“KRA should stop using Covid-19 as a scapegoat because this is not the first time it has missed its revenue collection target. It should innovate and increase their efficiency.” The National Treasury has revised the tax bands for salaried workers.
