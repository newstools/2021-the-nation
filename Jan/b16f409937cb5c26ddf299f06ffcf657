He offered his condolences to the families of the victims and to the government of the DRC, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN chief, in a statement.
The secretary-general reiterated his call for a global cease-fire and called on all armed groups to lay down their weapons.
He encouraged the authorities in DRC to take concrete steps to address the drivers of conflict in the eastern part of the country, the statement said.





Guterres reiterated the determination of the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC to continue to do its utmost to protect civilians in accordance with its mandate and to support national efforts to consolidate peace and stability in the country, it said.
