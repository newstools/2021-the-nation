He attributed this breakthrough to the good working relationship that his administration has with the medical workers, noting the fact that salaries were paid even in the months that they were not at work.
"As you all know our neighboring counties of Busia, Vihiga, Kakamega and a number of counties stopped the salaries of health workers and even went ahead to advertise for their positions but we are grateful that we have been able to pay our health workers and have now engaged in a dialogue that has brought a break through," Wangamati said.
