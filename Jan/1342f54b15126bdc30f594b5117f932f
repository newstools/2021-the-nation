KBF assistant secretary general Ambrose Kisoi clarified that KVF have only booked the indoor arena for their January 23 league opener, but were clear that they will not interfere with basketball calendar going forward.
There were fears that KBF would lose Nyayo Gymnasium to KVF this season after the latter announced the facility would host the opening leg of their league.
According to Kisoi, KBF will move the January 23 elections that were planned for the Nyayo indoor arena to one of the boardrooms at the stadiums to pave way for the volleyball league matches, but will return to the venue a week later for the pre-season tournament on January 30.





“We don’t have a problem with KVF using Nyayo on January 23, but going forward we are in agreement with them that basketball will be given priority for the use of the facility," he said.
Kisoi says KVF Deputy Treasurer Moses Mbuthia was very clear during their meeting that basketball will be given priority for use of Nyayo once the basketball season tips off with the pre-season tournament at the end of the month.
Kisoi, who will be seeking to replace Vitalis Gode as the KBF secretary general at the elections planned for next week, said the Morans team players had taken Covid-19 tests and only those players who turn negative will be allowed to start training at the Nyayo under assistant coach Sadat Gaya until coach Cliff Owuor, who is currently in Rwanda, joins the team in training anytime next week.

“We are taking the team’s preparations very seriously as we seek to qualify for the Afrobasket Championships to be staged in Rwanda next year," Kisoi said, while appealing to those players who did not take Covid-19 tests to do so.
Meanwhile, the stage is set for the KBF national elections after all counties concluded their elections last week with Mombasa and Kwale counties among the last to submit their list of delegates, according to Kisoi, who said those willing to vie for elective posts were expected to present their forms to the electoral body  by end of business Friday. New signings assemble in Mombasa for group training under strict Covid-19 protocols. The two are also part of the KPA women's basketball team. Mr Museveni leads with 4,340,134 million votes against NUP presidential candidate, Bobi Wine’s 2,164,347 votes. Earlier on Friday, the Ugandan opposition leader said the election had seen "widespread fraud and violence". Ugandan opposition leader rejects early results which gave President Yoweri Museveni a wide lead as a "joke".
