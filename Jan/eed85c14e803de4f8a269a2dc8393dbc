Musk has hit a stride after stumbling in 2018, when US securities regulators required the Tesla chief to step down as chairman and pay $20 million to settle charges he defrauded investors with false claims on Twitter in August about a possible bid to take the company private, which was quickly aborted.
Shares of Tesla surged 5.9 percent to $800.43 in late morning trading, lifting the company's market capitalization above $750 billion. The South African-born Musk, 49, added $7.2 billion in wealth on Monday alone following Tesla's latest surge.
