Kingstone have four points from three matches while Eastleigh have five points in as many matches. It's a must-win match for Kingstone while Eastleigh only need a draw to proceed.
Kajiado All Stars, under the tutelage of experienced coach Ezekiel Akwana, will be first on Ziwani grounds on Sunday 9.30am against Kayole Youth.
Despite majority of its players being secondary school students in the County, Akwana is optimistic they can carry their brilliant run of three wins and one draw in Group D to the knockout stage.





"The players were very motivated after winning their first two matches and put in more effort commuting from Kajiado County to Nairobi County to their fixtures with the only support coming from their parents," said Akwana.
With schools re-opening next week after a long Covid-19 enforced break, Akwana has his fingers crossed as they head into the business end of the competition.
"It's rather we lose in the final than drop out in the knockout stage. Reaching the final will be a good experience for the players," he added.
Kahawa Sportive will take on Dallas All Stars in the second match on Sunday starting 2.30pm.
Other Round 16 matches will see former champions Black Mamba and Umeme Bees take on Terror and Ruaraka All Stars respectively.
