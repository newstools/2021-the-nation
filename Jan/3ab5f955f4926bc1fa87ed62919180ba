Police in Suba, Homa Bay County, are hunting for a group of daring robbers who made an attempt to steal from the office of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the sub-county treasury office on Sunday night.
The robbers failed to break into the two offices but managed to steal valuables from another office and local shops within Magunga trading centre.

Suba Deputy County Commissioner Joseph Maina said the suspects escaped after they saw a police officer who was within the compound approaching them.
“The DCI office is in the same building with the sub-county treasury office. We are not sure which office they were intending to break into,” he said.
A pair of pliers and other cutting tools were found at the doorstep of the office.
Stole from other buildings
Later on Monday, security officers discovered that the suspects had broken into other buildings.
