Omollo, a former Gor Mahia defender who is also the Posta Rangers coach, did not mince his words, saying shoddy preparations occasioned by players' strike made the task hard for him.

"This team has to reassess its preparations for the continental competitions in future. However, I can't blame them since the problem was in the whole team's  preparations. The work we did was evident and I feel honoured to have led them in the four Caf games," he added.
No coach
The 51-year-old coach said he is also open to leading Gor Mahia in the upcoming Caf Confederation Cup play-off, but that would be subject to an agreement between his parent club and K’Ogalo.
The reigning champions do not have a coach after the exit of Brazilian Roberto Oliveira, who went back home to upgrade his coaching credentials, and his assistant Patrick ‘Pato’ Odhiambo, who has since been appointed Bandari assistant coach.

Gor Mahia striker Jules Ulimwengu, who scored Gor's goal on Wednesday, called on his teammates to focus on the upcoming matches.
