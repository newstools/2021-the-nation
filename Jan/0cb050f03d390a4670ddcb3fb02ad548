If you are a certified Kenyan, then you must have received an invitation card to a harambee at some point in your life. You might have smiled wryly at the “Guest of Honour” tag on your name but not objected to it.
The sound of your name called out at the said harambee might have massaged your ego as you walked to the podium to donate an amount of money equivalent to the huge title bestowed upon you. Like our politicians, you might have used giving as a passport to publicity and fame.

It’s a shame that self-aggrandisement comes too easily to us in matters giving. And social media has made the vice fester.
Clinton Onyango’s name may not be familiar to you but his story will be. A photo of the boy wearing torn sandals in school went viral this week. A Good Samaritan bought him a pair of shoes and posed for a photo for social media effect.





A touching gesture by any standards, but, as one person rightly pointed out in a WhatsApp group I belong to, it would be painful for the boy to go back to his classmates as the only one wearing shoes.
In his seminal autobiography The Boy with Shoes, Hillary Lisimba recounts how being the only boy with shoes in his village school made him an outsider and a subject of ridicule.
Clinton’s school and poverty-stricken family got the help that they needed from the public, but that’s not often the case. If the story had not caught the nation’s attention, he would have cut a lonesome figure in his “Toughees”.
The Starehe Boys Centre model of giving, as narrated by a former employee Maryana Munyendo during the WhatsApp debate, has nailed the art of giving.
“Part of our standard Form One reception package was a pair of Bata Toughees, whether you were paying fees or a fully sponsored student.

You could see the joy and pride in these young boys’ eyes. Imagine the joy from a child from Turkana who was number one in their county but used to go to school barefoot,” she said, adding that it was through watching such boys that she understood the concept of dignity even in poverty.
Some of the boys would use soap and exercise books sparingly so that they could save them for their siblings back home.
The harambee culture demands publicity for acts of goodwill, even as the Good Book, which a majority profess to follow, frowns upon it.
We may not be able to match the Starehe model, but we can try. We can start by thwarting the urge to showcase our acts of charity on social media. Can you imagine anything more humiliating? Giving should not be a dignity-fracturing affair.
Keeping charitable acts off social media won’t be sufficient to fix what ails us, but it will be a good start.
