A man who was arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of his parents at Muiu Village in Makueni County had differed with them over land inheritance, the Nation has established.
John Nzingu Ndivo, 70, is accused of hacking Ndivo Ndolo, 102, and Katumbi Ndivo, 96, at dawn on Wednesday. The man’s lifeless body was found in a pool of blood in the kitchen while the woman’s body was discovered in a maize plantation, according to a report by Makueni County Police Commander Joseph ole Napeiyan.

The two bodies had deep cut wounds in the heads. Police recovered a blood-stained machete and kitchen knife at the scene. They singled out Nzingu, who also had stab wounds on the neck, as the key suspect.
The 70-year-old  farmer had been on the police radar for long. He was arrested and detained in Salama Police Station in September after he had threatened unspecified harm on his parents. He was released shortly afterwards after his father intervened.





Family sources told the Nation the old man went ahead and forgave the first-born. However, the forgiveness did not guarantee the Ndivo household peace.
The bone of contention was a plan by the parents to share their 36-acre piece of land to all the siblings, including two daughters. An outdated Kamba custom bars daughters from inheriting land from their parents.
“The key suspect in the macabre deaths was opposed to his parents’ decision to enlist his two sisters among the beneficiaries of their land,” Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim told the Nation.
The administrator condemned the murder and pledged to have it resolved as quickly as possible and in line with the wishes of the deceased.
“Sons and daughters have the right to inherit property of their parents. When a parent is willing to give you a piece of land you can only accept it: you cannot give the parent conditions,” he said.
