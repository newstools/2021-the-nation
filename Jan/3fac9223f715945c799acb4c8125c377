Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has ordered chiefs and their assistants to conduct door-to-door search for missing learners, noting that the government is doing everything in its powers to ensure all students resume studies.
While admitting the government was facing several challenges in the re-opening of schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Matiang’i urged elected leaders in all the 47 counties to team up with the administrators to ensure learners are found and taken to school.

“We have channelled a lot of resources, our time and energies in ensuring everything works. We admit that not everything is working as we would want, but we are trying. We will overcome the challenges facing us,” said the CS.
The CS asked professionals in each of the regions to join hands and help improve the standards of education, adding leaders can only be proud if they nurture young ones.

He announced that he had joined hands with professionals from Gusii to ensure they do everything possible to improve the state of schools in the region.
Five classrooms
“We are building five classrooms at Egetonto Primary School in South Mugirango to improve its current status. We saw in the media how dilapidated it is and it is a shame when we leaders fail in our mandate. We do not want future generations to blame us,” he said.
The CS was speaking at Nyambaria Boys High School in Nyamira County and later at St Charlwes Lwanga Ichuni Girls High School in Kisii County where he inspected their preparedness to curb Covid-19 spread.
At Nyambaria Boys, the CS who was accompanied by Health PS Susan Mochache, Nyamira Woman Rep Jerusha Momanyi and Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose said that at least 60 learners had not returned to the school.

Most of the missing learners came from the region. “Others are from the neighbouring Narok County. I will talk to my brother Joseph ole Lenku, the Kajiado governor and his Narok County Samuel ole Tunai to help in tracing them,” he said.
He said President Uhuru Kenyatta is keen on seeing children and the youth advance, that is why the government is putting a lot of focus in ensuring smooth re-opening of schools.
Covid-19 protocols
“We are working with my colleague in the Education ministry Prof George Magoha and the entire Cabinet to ensure this becomes a success. We will not put anything to chance,” he said.
The CS, together with Ms Mochache, however, asked the learners to take personal responsibility over their health and ensure they observe the Covid-19 protocols.
“We can do everything as government to ensure your safety, but the biggest percentage lies with you. Put on your face masks properly and ensure you wash hands often. Keep distance as much as possible,” he said. On insecurity, he said the Interior ministry will not tolerate illegal gangs which have been terrorising Kenyans.
“We have heard gangs dressed in police uniform terrorising our people in Nyamira. We will not condone them here and in any other part of the country,” said the CS.

rmbula@ke.nationmedia.com Already, chiefs, village elders and members of Nyumba Kumi are moving from door to door hunting for learners who are still out of class. At least 20,000 learners in Grade 4, Standard Eight and Form Four have not gone back to school, signalling things can only get worse when all classes reopen in January. The former Nairobi governor also explains why he did not file an election petition. The university student is now the prime suspect in the multiple homicides his parents, brother, cousin and his father's worker. Tough-talking President Kenyatta tells off his critics, saying he is fully in charge of the country.
