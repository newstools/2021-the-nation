Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has officially declared interest in the Homa Bay governor office in the 2022 General Election.
Dr Kidero has pitched camp in the county governed by Mr Cyprian Awiti since Thursday evening, holding meetings with various groups as he starts seeking support.
So far, his bid has caught the attention of a number of professionals and politicians, including former Homa Bay Trade executive Carelus Ademba, former Homa Bay governor aspirant Enosh Bolo, former Kibiri ward MCA Kennedy Ondiek and Prof Jane Konditi.

The team has already started asking for votes, with Mr Ademba saying Dr Kidero will transform Homa Bay.
On Thursday, Dr Kidero held meetings in Karachuonyo, Kasipul, Rangwe and Kabondo Kasipul constituencies with residents in attendance.
The meetings took place at the homes of former Karachuonyo MP Phoebe Asiyo and the late University of Nairobi lecturer Ken Ouko.

ODM an option
On Saturday, the politician attended a prayer service at Agoro Sare Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church in Oyugis Town, Kasipul Constituency, where he asked for prayers as he seeks to take over from Mr Awiti.
Earlier, while on the way to church from his home in Asumbi, Rangwe Constituency, he made several stops at trading centres along Oyugis-Rodi Kopany road and spoke to the people, asking them to consider electing him their governor.
At the trading centres in Nyawita and Nyangiela, the former Mumias Sugar company boss gave out 2021 calendars with his picture to residents.
The calendars also have a picture of an orange, which shows he may consider vying under the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), whose leader is Raila Odinga.
Featured messages include “Homa Bay menyien” (loosely translated to ‘new Homa Bay’) and “Homabechwa gi Kidechwa” (Our Homa Bay our Kidero).

Dr Kidero’s convoy of high-end vehicles, led by police cars with sirens on, made several other stops in Karabok, Kosele, Kendu Bay, Kadel and Homa Bay Town.
Big dream
Dr Kidero served as Nairobi governor from 2013 to 2017, when Mike Sonko defeated him in the election.
He said his decision to contest in Homa Bay arose from his dream of serving the people in his rural home.
The politician declined to give details when he was asked about the move from the capital city to Homa Bay.
Last week, however, a group of elders from Kochia, Gem and Kagan pushed Dr Kidero to vie for the seat, saying they want their son to be the county’s next leader.
At the trading centres and in his local dialect, Dr Kidero promised to create jobs for the youth should he win the position.
"Homa Bay used to have a cotton factory which collapsed. I will review cotton farming to create jobs for the youth," he said.
He added that he will transform the health sector and improve sanitation.
The politician also drummed up support for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).

Dr Kidero says his development track record and service delivery to Nairobians is unrivalled. The man who holds a Nigerian passport was on Friday night arrested in connection with a gruesome killing in Syokimau. Stephen Thuku was reportedly blocked by another car at Nairobi’s Githurai Mwihoko area by three armed men. Politicians express their views on matters including the 2022 poll and Mudavadi's position as Mama Hannah is buried.
