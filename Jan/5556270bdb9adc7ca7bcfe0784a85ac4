Facebook barred US President Donald Trump from posting Wednesday over messages it said were promoting violence as his supporters stormed the US Capitol — following a similar stand taken by Twitter.
The sanctions came after the president took to social media to issue a series of false claims — including in a short video — about the election he lost to Joe Biden having been stolen from him.

});
}, 62000);
}



"We made the decision that on balance these posts contribute to, rather than diminish, the risk of ongoing violence," Facebook said.
The California-based social media giant said it was handing Trump "a 24-hour feature block" preventing him from posting.
Twitter blocked Trump earlier on Wednesday and threatened a permanent ban for breaking its own rules with his false claims about the election.
