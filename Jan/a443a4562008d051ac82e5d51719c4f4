Schools have resumed across the country after a nine-month break following the Covid-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Education has promised to provide free masks for children from low income homes.
The concerted efforts by the government includes hiring additional 5,000 teachers and 12,000 interns. Despite the challenges of observing other protocols especially maintaining social distancing, the ministry is urging teachers to be innovative in order to utilise spaces within their compounds for learning.

There are fears of massive dropouts due to the prolonged closure. When schools partially reopened, reports suggested that thousands of students did not turn up, especially in rural areas.
Others remained at home while their parents monitored the health situation in the country. As we kick-start the second term, we must look into factors that are likely to cause a substantial rate of dropout.





Pregnant
Last year, a national debate ensued about a teen pregnancy report. The numbers were shocking and it pricked the conscience of the society.
About 13,000 school children in Kilifi County, 6,000 in Nandi and 4000 in Machakos were pregnant. When schools were closed, girls were exposed to early marriages, pregnancies and sexual abuses. The society seemed to have seen the other way while this grievous culture took root.
Economic activities
The statistics we have from different counties is alarming and is a pointer that all is not well even as schools reopen. Thousands of girls as young as 10 years are not likely to return to class since they are pregnant. The numbers paint a grim picture of learners whose future has been jeopardised.
The effects of this will be catastrophic if nothing is done to address it. On the other hand, early marriages — which are prevalent in far flung areas — could be another impediment that is likely to contribute to dropout of many girls.

Poor backgrounds
Boys too are not safe, especially in rural areas where they have turned to different economic activities. Despite the boda-boda sector contributing immensely to the economy, there is a growing trend of school boys from poor backgrounds to join the sector in order to support their families.
A simple survey shows that boys as young as 13 are finding it easy to join the sector. This may end up motivating them to remain in business at the expense of going back to school.
Chiefs and Nyumba Kumi committees have a role to play to help trace absentee learners within their areas of jurisdiction. Parents and the community should also ensure children are enrolled back to school despite the tough economic challenges they might be facing. We all have a role to play in building strong and prosperous communities by ensuring our children are in school.
