Nairobi County Disaster Management and Coordination Chief Officer Anne Mwenda will next week Friday be vetted by the Nairobi County Assembly for the deputy governor position.
This is after the High Court allowed the withdrawal of a petition by a Nairobi voter, Peter Agoro, that was challenging her nomination for the position by former Governor Mike Sonko.

The withdrawal of the case paved way for vetting of Ms Mwenda which had been put on hold early last year when her name was submitted to the assembly's appointment and vetting committee.
In a public notice released Thursday evening by Nairobi County Assembly Clerk Edward Gichana, Ms Mwenda will now face the committee on January 15. The position became vacant following the resignation of Polycarp Igathe in January 2018.
The 40-year-old was nominated by Mr Sonko on January 6, 2020 before the name was submitted to the assembly the same month.

});
}, 62000);
}



But Mr Agoro moved to court challenging her nomination.  
The High Court on February 17, 2020 issued conservatory orders preventing the assembly from proceeding with the vetting process.
However, the order was lifted yesterday (Thursday), after the court allowed an application for the withdrawal of the petition against Ms Mwenda.
"In the circumstances, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(4) and 7(5) of the Public Appointments (County Assemblies) Approval Act, 2017, notice is hereby given of an approval hearing to be undertaken by the County Assembly’s Select Committee on Appointments, on January 15, 2021, In the County Assembly Plenary Chamber starting 10.30 am, in relation to the above-named nominee," read the notice.

It further said: "The nominee is required to collect the vetting forms from the Office of the Clerk to the County Assembly during official working hours as from January 8, 2021 and return them together with copies of the following documents by January 11, 2021 at 5pm." 
The documents include curriculum vitae/personal credentials/academic certificates and other testimonials; compliance certificate from Higher Education Loans Board (HELB); compliance certificate from Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and clearance certificate from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
Other documents are certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI); and clearance certificate from the Credit Reference Bureau.
"The nominee shall be required to come with the original documents on the day of the approval hearing," said the notice. Sonko, in sworn affidavit, claims President Kenyatta's sister Christina Pratt attempted to influence appointment of his deputy. The former governor wants any possible vetting of Ms Mwenda stopped. Politicians led by Johnson Muthama, Susan Kihika and Kipchumba Murkomen say they have found peace and equality. The investigations have been narrowed down to close family members as well as the extended family. Employment Court quashed the appointment of Ms Wambui as the chairperson of the National Employment Authority.
