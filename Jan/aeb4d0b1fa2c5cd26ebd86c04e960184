Rwanda has put Kigali under 15-day lockdown to tame spread of Covid-19. The capital city has seen a second wave after authorities relaxed some restrictions.
The move comes after a virtual meeting chaired by President Paul Kagame on Monday.
In a statement, the government called on Rwandans to heighten vigilance in observing the Covid-19 health guidelines to slow down the spread of the virus.
