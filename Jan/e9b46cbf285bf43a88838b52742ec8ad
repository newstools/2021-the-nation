Regarding phase one, Dr Mwangangi said, Kenya has prioritised the vaccination of 1.25 million people at a time when it is expected that global vaccine stocks will be limited.
"The people to be covered in this period include frontline health workers and all staff in health facilities in both the public and private sectors," she said.
"Also prioritised are workers undertaking essential services in priority sectors like security and immigration."










Phase two will target 9.7 million people aged above 50 years and those over 18 years and with underlying health conditions.
Phase three, which will run concurrently with phase two "depending on the availability of vaccines", will also target 4.9 people, including "all other vulnerable populations like those in congregate settings".
