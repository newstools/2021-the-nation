} Organisation challenges government to suspend accused officials, pending investigations, and to ensure victims access to justice. Motorcycle-riding gunmen stormed Kungi village in Kaduna state, killing one and taking away 30 people, residents said. They are the new chair and vice chair succeeding Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), respectively. Jubilee party official says BBI was sold in Mount Kenya by force “and Murang'a Senator did nothing bad to highlight these issues to the President.” Minister says new time zone is based on South Sudan’s location on the globe.
