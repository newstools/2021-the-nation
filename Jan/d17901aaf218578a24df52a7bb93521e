The enraged police officer then attacked the warder and a fight broke out.
One witness said the policeman found his estranged wife having supper with the warder, a sergeant at the prison.
They exchanged blows and the warder was overpowered.
It was then that the warder grabbed his Ceska pistol and shot the policeman twice in the head, killing him on the spot, and then turned the weapon on himself.
