The best teams at the constituency level will fight for top honours which include cash prizes, full playing kits and balls.





Speaking after awarding the winners of Keyian and Shankoe wards at Enosaen grounds, Tasur said that he will sponsor best teams from the wards in the FKF sub branch league.
“As part of promoting the talents among the youths and improving the football skills in the region, I will register seven teams and each team registration will cost Sh21, 000,” said Tasur.
He also said that they have a scouting team at every ward who will look out for best talents throughout the competition.
“Apart from supporting these teams in the local leagues, we are also planning to get best talents in the tournament who will therefore form a strong and formidable team that I will sponsor up to the top flight league,” he said.
The tournament sponsor noted apart from developing sports activities, they also intend to use the event to sensitise  various communities in the region on the need for peaceful coexistence.

The event mostly targeted the rival Maasai, Kipsigis, Kisii and Kuria communities who have been engaging in cattle rustling, land disputes among other cross border conflicts.
“Such sporting activities would offer a platform to the local youths from the various ethnic backgrounds to interact and share their diverse cultural beliefs so as to become tolerant to each other,” said Tasur.
