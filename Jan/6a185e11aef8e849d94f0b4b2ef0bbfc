Via Twitter on Sunday, the DCI said the student will be charged with murder following the death of Willy Mukonambi. The guard died at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu County.
"The student became unruly and attacked other students using a metal rod, when the guard identified as Mukonambi intervened," the tweet stated.
"The student turned on the guard and hit him on the head repeatedly using the rod. The guard was taken to hospital in a critical condition."
The DCI cited Section 203 read together with Section 204 of the Penal Code.





Section 203 says: “Any person who, of malice aforethought, causes the death of another person by an unlawful act or omission is guilty of murder.”
Mayhem
The student was later moved to Serem Police Station.
Hamisi Deputy OCPD Joseph Gatuku said the student caused mayhem in a dormitory.
"Watchmen responded to distress calls from other students but the boy picked up a metal rod and hit one of them on the head. Once investigations are through, he will be charged in court. The DCI has taken over the matter," he said.
The school’s board convened a special meeting on Monday to discuss the matter.
Its chair, Dr Hudson Aluvanze, said the incident is not a reflection of the character of Nyang’ori’s students.

Dr Aluvanze termed the incident shocking and regrettable but said it was isolated.
He added that calm was restored as the county education office, police and the school administration took full control of the situation.
