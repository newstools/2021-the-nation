Fire-fighting equipment belonging to the Kericho county government helped to put out the fire after members of the public and students were overwhelmed.
"The twin dormitory held 300 students with one side having been destroyed by the fire," said Joseph Birdai, the Bureti sub-county director of education.
The school's principal, Alfred Abuya, said a few items belonging to students were salvaged from the inferno.
"Beds, mattresses, blankets, school uniforms, books and other items belonging to the students have been reduced to ashes," said Mr Abuya.





On Sunday, fire broke out at Olomirani Secondary School in the neighbouring Narok County in the third week since the reopening of schools after their closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Various sources have claimed an electric fault was the major cause of the frequent fires at the school. It started at the workshop and spread to the study block, acting director says. ODM leader says the two are sides of the same coin, founded on very solid and enduring principles. The politician is under effective house arrest guarded by soldiers and police. One of the robbers was left guarding the gate and even kept opening it for motorists.
