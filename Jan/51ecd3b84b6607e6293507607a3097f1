At least 17 young men from Tiaty were on Friday night arrested on Marigat-Mogotio road, police said. 
Police said the men were aboard a lorry ferrying more than 100 goats. 
Mogotio Deputy County Commissioner Albert Mwaringa said the men will be investigated and questioned about their movement during curfew hours without authorisation. The administrator said the men were probably escaping the ongoing security operation in Tiaty sub-county.

Mr Mwaringa said the suspects were taken to Mogotio pending further investigation. This comes after post-mortem examinations revealed six people killed in Baringo South were tortured before they were shot dead.
