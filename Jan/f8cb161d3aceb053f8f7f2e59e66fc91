Kutesa said the heavy security deployment in the capital Kampala and surrounding areas during the election process was intended to ensure "domestic tranquillity, the security and welfare of its citizens."
"We would like to reassure the international community that this tranquillity will continue to prevail beyond the immediate aftermath of the elections, into the future," he said.
The minister said Uganda has sufficient capacity to deal with its affairs and rejects foreign interference in its internal affairs.





Incumbent President Yoweri Museveni won the elections with 58.64 percent of the vote. Museveni now becomes the fourth longest serving president in Africa. Museveni claims the election was the “most cheating-free” poll in Uganda’s history. Other BBI backers' names missing include ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and trade unionist Francis Atwoli. He was held at the Kileleshwa police station in Nairobi. Development comes months after Talai Council of Elders crowned DP to lead the community.
