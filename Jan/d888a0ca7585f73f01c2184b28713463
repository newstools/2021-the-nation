It was a low-key affair in Naivasha as residents ushered in the new year with few activities outdoors.
With police enforcing the curfew, people kept away from entertainment joints for fear of rubbing law enforcers the wrong way.
Heavy rainfall experienced throughout the night further dampened what is usual a convivial mood over the past few years.

"The curfew rule kept most of us away and I chose to enjoy my drink inside the house," said Kinyua Kabura, a resident. 
Major incidents
Naivasha Police Commander Samuel Waweru said no major incident had been reported throughout the festivities.
"It was an almost incident free festivity...we are yet to record any shocking occurrence," he said.
Mr Waweru said security had been heightened during the Christmas and New Year celebrations.

Governor Lee Kinyanjui urged residents to be hopeful, as 2021, he said will bring better tidings.
"We thank God we have made it. We step into the New Year with the hope of better tidings for our county and nation,” he said.
Overcome challenges
Moses Esekon, the national chairperson of Vijana Tuomoke na BBI, said: “I urge my fellow youth to avoid drugs and excessive drinking. I appeal to the youth to play a key role in championing the youth agenda by electing fellow youths in the county and national assemblies in the coming year”.
In her New Year message, Bishop Margaret Mwihaki of Kings Assembly urged Kenyans to put their hopes on God to overcome challenges ahead.
“The just ended pandemic year was tough and as a country we lost many people, the economy collapsed and I urge Kenyans to pray hard for God’s blessings,” said Bishop Mwihaki

Worship places
In Nakuru town, hundreds of residents turned up in places of worship to pray for people who died from Covid-19.
At Prophet David Owuor's Repentance and Holiness Kings Outreach church, hundreds of worshippers started streaming in as early as 5pm.
“We gathered her to pray that God intervenes and heals Kenya and the World in 2021,” said Mr Vitalis Omondi.
Places of worship in informal settlements also attracted hundreds of worshippers.
In Nakuru town, there were no firework celebrations like in previous years. Kenyatta Avenue remained deserted and only police officers patrolled the streets.
Police led by Nakuru Town East Police commander Ellena Kabukuru arrested residents who contravened curfew rules.
However, revelers at the Platinum 7D Lounge defied the curfew order to enjoy their favourite drinks as they ushered in the new year.
Empty malls
The shopping malls in the town were virtually empty, a clear evidence of harsh economic times.
However, bookshops and uniform shops were a beehive of activity as parents packed the outlets to buy school items ahead of the reopening of schools on January 4.
“This is a tough year for me. I lost my job as a shop attendant due to Coronavirus. The little money I’m spending to buy school uniforms and other items, I was paid when my services were terminated in October,” said Joseph Kinuthia.

Evade police
In Taita Taveta County, Kenyans spent night dodging police, with some opting to cross the border to celebrate New Year in Tanzania, where there are less-restrictive Covid-19 measures. 
Hundreds of Kenyans spent their time at the Holili border in Taveta.
Taking advantage of a favourable foreign exchange rate, they extended their party before returning to their country in a convoy of motorbikes singing songs condemning the introduction of curfew rules and stringent Covid-19 measures.
"We have strong currency compared to Tanzania and we can afford to buy what we want. We cannot afford to stay in the house as we cross new year that is why we had to go our neighboring country," said John Mwalekwa.
He added: "With Sh1500, we can buy what we want and with financial constraints as a result of Covid-19, that was only way we could do it best. We organized ourselves and moved in number and we are happy we are back to plan how our children will go back to school".
At home
In Mombasa, many residents spent their New Year's Eve at home like many other Kenyans in compliance with the curfew rule.
Some took time to make merry at hotels with friends hours to the countdown into the new year.
Residents watched firework displays at Fort Jesus and EnglishPoint Marina where they opted to have the fireworks display at around 9:30pm.

Cynthia Mwikali, a resident of Tudor estate, said this has been a unique new year celebration, with no hype.
"I would be out to literally crossover into the new year but the Covid-19 has messed us up. I am however grateful be see a new year and I pray for good health for my friends and family," Ms Mwikali said.

He said that many things happened in 2020 that made Kenyans afraid but encouraged them to look into the Year 2021 with boldness and courage.
"Covid-19 brought us some delays, detours and derailments but we cannot allow it to stop from doing God's will," Bishop Arati said.

By Macharia Mwangi, Eric Matara, Francis Mureithi, Anthony Kitimoand Wachira Mwangi Celebrations across the world were largely muted as countries maintained rules to contain the spread of Covid-19. The new year has a rude welcome in the end of the Covid-19 tax reliefs. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years.
