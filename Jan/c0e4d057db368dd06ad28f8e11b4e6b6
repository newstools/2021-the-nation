The club’s fortunes have ebbed more than they have flowed over the years, their survival anchored in that idealism of being the “people’s club.”And unlike other outfits that have come and gone, Muthaiga RFC, Ruiru, Machakos SC, Thika SC, Kenya Breweries RFC, Barclays Bank RFC, Stanchart Bank RFC, Faru RFC, Ulinzi RFC etc, Mwamba --43 years old and counting, will stay and find a new home. It was heartening news to the passionate rugby fraternity in the country when the union recently released tentative Kenya Cup fixtures for the 2021 season.
After more than a year of inactivity due to the Covid-19 pandemic elite rugby will be returning to the Kenyan pitches.
Mwamba RFC will play their first game at home to Blak Blad on February 27. This season will be the first since 1978 that the proud and resilient Mwamba will not have Nairobi Railway Club as their designated home ground.

The state forcefully acquired the facility for the expansion of Uhuru Highway and construction of a bus terminus.
Mwamba are now actively looking for a home ground. I understand they have been pursuing several options around Upper Hill, Parklands, Ngong Road and other areas, all within Nairobi County.
It is a throwback to 1978 when Mwamba was founded. Mwamba’s formation was steeped in African idealism and the desire for social, racial and economic equality, not to mention national pride.

Founder members of the club have radiated nostalgic pleasure in forming “our own team, owned and run by Africans”, in several conversations I have held with them. Rugby in the early years after independence was decidedly racist.
This is often never spoken about, but top clubs then were owned by whites who openly discriminated against their African compatriots.
“We saw and felt the racism. We were an African country and wanted to assert ourselves. Many of us wondered why Kenyan representative sides were mostly white yet we had many deserving black players who could easily make the team,” Frank Ojiambo, a club legend and one of the founder members of Mwamba told me.
His voice lighting up as he recalled the formation period, Ojiambo said they got a lot of resistance from the rugby establishment that was averse to an African side being formed.

He says a representative side of African only players called Miro RFC was first formed in 1974 before Mwamba the club was born in 1978.
“It was a true representative of a rugby side from Kenya and was even open to whites. It was exciting and exhilarating for us in those early years. Many top players who had suffered from the discrimination joined us. We were together and shared a common bond,” Ojiambo recalls.
Any player who has played university rugby can attest to this kindred brotherhood. In fact, the bulk of the players who joined this new club were immediate former members of University of Nairobi’s Mean Machine.
They were the same lads, who had won the prestigious Kenya Cup with a swashbuckling Mean Machine side a year earlier in 1977.
They included Absalom “Bimbo” Mutere, prop Couts Otolo, flanker Tom Oketch, winger Shapi Kadir, centre Ben Mukuria, scrum half George Mng’ong’o, who was Mwamba’s inaugural captain.
They were joined by amongst others, eighth man Dennis Awori, previously at Kenya Harlequin, the hard-hitting Ojiambo and flanker Sam “Sky” Akatsa, who had also left Quins.
Nevertheless, the new Mwamba had to find a home first.

According to multiple interviews, I gather, just like the current homeless Mwamba is doing, the pioneer side of the late 1970s earnestly scouted for a venue in Upper Hill, Agricultural Society of Kenya showground in Jamhuri and other areas around Nairobi.

One story that is spoken of in resigned frustration is of a piece of land in South C that Mwamba acquired from the authorities.
The team even started working on the plot, planting grass and trees with the intention of eventually building a rugby facility there only to wake up one morning to find the ground being developed into a residential estate.
But they were happy at Railway Club which was offered for their use by the once prosperous parastatal.
The venue was conveniently located just within walking distance of Nairobi’s CBD, one of the main reasons why yours truly played for the club for one-half season in 1996.
However, it was not all-smooth sailing in as far as having home status at Nairobi Railway. One time Parliament wanted to extend its land to Railways for the honourable members’ use. But that idea died as naturally as it had started.
Mwamba, for one reason or another have also had to temporarily relocate their training to Nairobi School, Upper Hill School, Uhuru Park, South C and so on. Anyway, back to the heady formation years.
Nation rugby writer Jaykhee Carbosh wrote thus in his Kenya Cup season preview of February 25, 1978: “The claim that Mean Machine is the best side in the Kenya Cup will be a challenge for Absalom ‘Bimbo’ Mutere of Mwamba RFC and Rod Evans of Nondies Club, captains of the defending champs’ closest challengers respectively.”

The black shirts though had to wait until 1983 to win their first and only Kenya Cup title.
These was during the true golden years of “Kulabu” as they went on to win the Enterprise Cup in 1985 and 1986.
The club’s fortunes have ebbed more than they have flowed over the years, their survival anchored in that idealism of being the “people’s club.”

For the idea that led to its formation will surely live on.
