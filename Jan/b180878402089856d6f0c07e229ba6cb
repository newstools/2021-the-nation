We watched citizens troop to political rallies in defiance of the Ministry of Health’s Covid-19 guidelines.Last year the PPEs that were donated to help deal with Covid-19 disappeared mysteriously while tenders for the procurement of the same were awarded to passers-by. Last year was no doubt the most difficult in recent times and the dawn of 2021 signified renewed hope. As the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the country, the political class continued to dance to the political tunes, oblivious of the sufferings of their people. To them, the 2022 General Election and the referendum were more pressing concerns.

Instead of Parliament enacting legislative measures to cushion ordinary citizens, MPs were busy in political rallies.
Before I chide the politicians, the people are equally to blame. We watched citizens troop to political rallies in defiance of the Ministry of Health’s Covid-19 guidelines. They listened and cheered as the politicians addressed their ambitions, instead of pressing concerns such as the effects of pandemic.
The Constitution bestows sovereignty on the people. This sovereignty should not just be exercised every five years when we elect our leaders but every other time in holding them accountable. It is ridiculous when elected officials yell on social media and in rallies instead of using their positions to push for changes.

The media has been busy interviewing government officials about their experience with Covid-19. What the officials do not say is that had they been left in the care of local public hospitals, they could now be in the other world, perhaps singing with the angels or answering for their sins. Health workers are on strike. Little is said of that.
More political seats
The ordinary parent’s most pressing concern is not whether or not the son of a peasant can be President or the addition of more political seats, but whether they can take their child to school and access health care.

Already, we have started the year on a false start. As the students reported back to school, Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha urged teachers to be innovative and let students learn under trees as a solution to congestion in classrooms. This would have been funny had we not been talking about the lives and the future of our children. It is like telling a person without clothes to be innovative enough and walk naked.
Teaching under trees
Rwanda has constructed over 20,000 schools and when Prof Magoha was asked about that, he said that we should not compare ourselves to a smaller country whose population is like that of one region in Kenya. One would have thought that our bigger population is a resource that can help us do more. The irony is that those who tell our teachers to be innovative enough and teach children under trees always take their children to international schools and abroad. Maybe that explains ‘their disconnect’ with the suffering of the ordinary citizens.
We must think of innovative solutions. Instead of children learning under trees, we can have the military, the National Youth Service and community volunteers help put up temporary classrooms for the kids. That would be cheaper and would guarantee them some relative comfort as they learn.

Last year the PPEs that were donated to help deal with Covid-19 disappeared mysteriously while tenders for the procurement of the same were awarded to passers-by. To date it is said that PPEs continue to waste away at Kemsa warehouse even as health workers and school children lack masks.

We expect vaccines to be received this year. I cringe when I imagine that it is the same Kemsa that may be entrusted with the procurement and distribution of the vaccines.
Unless we hold the Covid-19 millionaires accountable, the vaccines will suffer the same fate. There is no magic in the number 2021. Whether or not it will be prosperous will purely depend on how we define our priorities as a nation.

Talk that the presidency is not the preserve of two communities risks dividing the country along tribal lines, he says. Independent candidates invited for a meeting in Nairobi later said they had been duped.
