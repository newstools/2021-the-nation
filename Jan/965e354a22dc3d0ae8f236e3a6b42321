Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero now claims he won the gubernatorial election in 2017 but was not declared the victor by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
Dr Kidero, who has hit the road running in his bid to become Homa Bay’s governor in 2022, says he is confident that he defeated Mike Sonko, who has now been impeached.

Dr Kidero served as Nairobi governor for one term - from  2013 to 2017 - under the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. He lost the election to Sonko who vied on the Jubilee Party ticket.
After the electoral commission declared Sonko the winner, he conceded defeat, thanked residents for allowing him to serve them and promised a smooth transition of power.
No petition
Dr Kidero, who once was the Mumias Sugar company's boss,  did not file a petition against the election result as his colleagues from other counties did.

On Sunday, he explained that he did not take that route because he knew he would not succeed and because the process would have been a waste of time and money.
“I am certain that I was not defeated in the 2017 General Election in Nairobi. I wanted to petition the election results but later retracted after realising the petition would fail,” he said at Christ the Healer Anglican Church of Kenya in Homa Bay Town.
“Up till now, no petition has sailed through so I would have wasted time and money.”
No easy task
Regarding management of the capital city, Dr Kidero said it is not a walk in the park.
“They have jumped from the frying pan into the fire. They thought I was the pan. I hope they have learned their lessons,” he said, in apparent reference to the many controversies that tainted Sonko’s tenure.

Dr Kidero wants to succeed Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti, who is set to retire in 2022.
He has been crisscrossing the county since last week, seeking to endear himself to the voters. He has also convened several meetings with different groups in the county and spent time in churches.
The former county boss, who hails from Asumbi in Rangwe Constituency, urged the public to elect leaders who are knowledgeable, experienced, passionate, driven and visionary.
Homa Bay is home
Dr Kidero dismissed criticism from a section of leaders from Homa Bay who have told him not to vie in his home county.
“I was born here. I grew up here and partly went to school here. I have made some investments in Homa Bay so I am certainly interested in vying for the governor seat,” he said.
He added that he does not tolerate laziness and has the experience required to run Homa Bay, which he described as a county with resources that are under-utilised.
Other politicians who have shown interest in succeeding Governor Cyprian Awiti Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe, former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, businessman Jared Kiasa and Akelo Misori, Secretary-General of the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet).
