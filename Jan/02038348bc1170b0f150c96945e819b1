Busolo said that the January Open tournament is important because they will start selecting national team members from it, adding that with good preparations, Kenya should improve on her global ranking. In the global scene, Kenya is currently ranked 39th.“I believe we can improve our ranking this year because we have the talent. If we put more effort and the government supports us as they have promised, nothing should stop us from performing well,” she said. Despite having not played any match since last year due to Covid-19 pandemic, Millicent Busolo, the Kenya Netball Federation (KNF) Secretary General, believes the national team will perform well at the international scene this year.
KNF plans to kick-off this year’s activities with a two-day open tournament in Nairobi on January 30 and 31, after which the first leg of the national league will take place from February 26 to 28.

“The aim of the tournament is to set the momentum for netball activities after a long break in the country.
From it, we will also seek to find out the teams that will compete in this year’s league,” Busolo told Nation Sport on Wednesday.
Netball is among the low risk contact sports that the Ministry of Sports allowed to resume in the country from November last year.
According to the calendar of events that the federation released on December 28, several local tournaments and international events will take place in between the national league, in a season that will end with the International Netball Federation (INF) Youth World Cup and Congress in Fiji in December.





Kenya will not feature in the global contest as the Africa qualifiers that were planned for last year in Uganda were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the INF gave tickets to the top three countries in Africa – South Africa, Uganda and Malawi.
The international games where Kenya hopes to feature are; East Africa Netball Association Club Championships in Uganda (March), Africa Cup Women in Namibia ( May/June), Africa Men Championships in South Africa (September) and the Singapore Nations Cup (October).

And with the national league having failed to take place last year because of the pandemic, Busolo said that should the EANA Club Championships proceed as planned, the federation will give direct tickets to Ulinzi and Prisons, the top teams in the country.
