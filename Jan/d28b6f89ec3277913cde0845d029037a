"The fire has been contained from spreading to other structures in the school through an effort by members of the public, students and fire marshals from the county government of Bomet," said Mr Stanley Mutai, the county disaster management officer.
The incident is said to have occurred at 5am as students were preparing for early morning studies.
A few items were salvaged from the fire with blankets, mattresses, bedsheets, books and other properties belonging to the students being destroyed in the inferno.

A few days earlier, a similar incident occurred at Olomirani Secondary School in the neighbouring Narok County. Five students have been charged after allegedly attacking their teachers or schoolmates. The cause of the inferno, which has been put out, has not been established.
