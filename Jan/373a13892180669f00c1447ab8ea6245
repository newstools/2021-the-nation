In Samburu, education officials have directed schools to set aside safe and sanitary spaces for breastfeeding. 

In Kisumu County, some school heads who sought anonymity said many teen mothers have transferred to other schools to avoid the stigma that comes with pregnancy. 

However, Kisumu county director of education Isaac Atebe said they are yet to come up with the statistics of the expectant and teen mothers who have resumed school. 

In parts of the South Rift, a number of the learners who are in various stages of pregnancy have reported to schools, said Bomet County Director of Education Mabale Indiatsi. Most of the girls who fell pregnant in the region are said to have been married off during the holidays.

Turkana County director of education Peter Magiri said inspection of schools was on-going to ensure that all expectant girls are admitted and supported in their studies. In Nandi, County Commissioner Geoffrey Omoding said most of the teenage mothers are yet to report back due to lack of special facilities. 

“Schools need to adjust their programmes to ensure teenage mothers and pregnant girls receive special treatment,” said Mr Omoding. A report by the Education ministry and Department of Health indicates that about 10,000 girls got pregnant during the long holiday in the county and about 80 percent of them have not reported back to school.
