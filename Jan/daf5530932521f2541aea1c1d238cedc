President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have expanded their land portfolio in Narok by buying more acres in the county, a situation that is likely to sway politics in the county in 2022 and after.
The two now own land in the newly created Transmara South Sub-County, with the region turning into VIP territory since it is also home to Narok Governor Samuel Tunai.

The President ushered in 2021 at his ranch of more than 1,000 acres next to the Maasai Mara game reserve where he held meetings with local leaders who will now discuss the political and development course of the region.
He acquired two parcels of land adjacent to each other from Oloirien and Kiringani group ranches and another parcel at the Oloololo escarpment to build a tourist resort.
Gazette notice
Through a Kenya Gazette notice December 31, 2020, President Kenyatta created the new administrative unit, which was part of Trans Mara West Sub-County in Narok County.





It will have five divisions: Sitoka, Lolgorian, Ongata, Kerindon and Kereto.
The new sub-county will become a new constituency, subject to confirmation by the Independent Electorate and Boundaries Commission.
The constituency will therefore become the seventh in the county, the others being Narok North, Narok South, Narok East, Narok West, Trasmara East and Trasmara West.
The Head of State held a private meeting with Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, MCAs Kuyo ole Kijabe (Kimintet) and Michael Seme (Lolgorian) and community elders and requested them to be involved in all decision-making in the area.
Mobilise elders
Sources indicated that the Mr Seme, the MCA of the area the President bought land, has been ordered to mobilise elders from the area for a meeting at State House where further discussions on development and political paths to be taken would be discussed.

The President, who spent seven days in the area at Angama Mara luxury camp, further promised to tarmac the Ololulunga-Ngoringori-Lemek-Aitong-Lolgorian road and since the area is now a sub-county, 10 youths will be employed by the army, police and other discipline forced annually.
Other development projects to be initiated in the area are a Level 3 hospital that will be built in Kawai trading centre, and a nursery and primary school.
Jomo Kenyatta
The President has roots in the local community – his great-grandfather, Magana, had a Maasai wife, Susana Musana.
After renaming her Wanjiru, the two sired a child, Muigai, who fathered Kamau wa Ngengi (Jomo Kenyatta), Kung’u Muigai and James Ngengi.
Being a new entrant in the area, he joins his DP, who bought former Vice President Joseph Murumbi’s Intona ranch.
The DP, who is Governor Tunai’s neighbour, acquired the land six year ago after paying off a loan Murumbi owed the Agricultural Finance Corporation.
Both the president and his assistant are venturing into livestock ranching, according to close sources. Already, the DP has stocked hundreds of beef cattle on the ranch and he has been travelling there most weekends.





An endorsement
Dr Ruto publicly showed interest in the region’s politics when he attended the burial of former Narok Senator Stephen ole Ntutu's mother, Nalangu Enole Ntutu. He asked Narok residents to elect the Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Patrick ole Ntutut as their governor in 2022 to succeed Mr Tunai, who is serving his second and final term as governor.

The DP is seen as trying to resuscitate Purko clan politics appealing to residents to elect a county boss from the clan, a political ideology that the current governor supports.
The DP, who referred to Narok as his second home told mourners: “Now that Patrick is among those who are in the race from the Purko clan to succeed Governor Samuel Tunai, we endorse that decision, but all of the leaders should seat down and agree in this positions”.
It has been agreed that the governor will come from Narok while the senator will be from the Maasai in Trans Mara, and this plan has raised resistance and support in equal measures.
Mr Ntutu lost to Mr Tunai in 2017.
Welcome proposal
Maasai Professionals chairman Joseph Sonkori welcomed the DP’s proposal for Mr Ntutu to become the next governor, saying he has what it takes to be governor and he has experience working with the government.
“Serving as an MP for Narok west, and now as an assistant minister he has needed experience to propel this county to the next level,” said Mr Sokori. 
Mr Ntutu father, Paramount Chief Lerionka Ntutu, had ruled the roost up to the late 1980s.
Senator Stephen ole Ntutu (the CAS’ elder brother) was senator until 2017 when he called it quits for his brother to run for governor.

Now the CAS is facing off with Narok West MP Gabriel ole Tongoyo, another Purko, who had publicly said he also expected the DP’s blessings.
Others expected to take a stab at the county top seat are Narok South MP Korei ole Lemein, Narok Senator Ledama Olekina and Woman Representative Soipan Kudate. President Uhuru Kenyatta has created one more sub-county in Narok, bringing the total number to seven. The DP showered praises on the CAS, saying he has done a lot in unifying and developing the region. Bobi Wine has also revealed that his National Unity Platform (NUP) party has established an independent tallying centre to check against potential rigging. The move means Ugandans will cast their ballots amidst an internet blackout. President Donald Trump urges 'NO violence' and appeals for calm in the US as Congress debates his impeachment.
