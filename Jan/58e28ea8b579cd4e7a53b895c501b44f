It is difficult to suppress our scepticism in this new year, having gone through the toughest 10 months of our lives.On top of your usual resolutions, include the most important one: to keep the faith and remain optimistic. Over lunch with a friend on Wednesday, he jokingly pointed out that he will not be adding the year 2020 to his age because he hardly used it.
Similar jokes I have seen about 2020 include a hilarious one that some of us will not include 2020 in our CVs, and if quizzed about it by a hawk-eyed recruiter, we will tell them we spent 2020 washing hands, sanitising, maintaining social distance and wearing masks.

That is what 2020 has been to all of us. A wasted year. A year of disappointments. Lost opportunities. Cancellations. Stolen dreams. Delayed achievements. A year of death and pain to nations and families.
It is difficult to suppress our scepticism in this new year, having gone through the toughest 10 months of our lives. However, my point — and the purpose of this column — is that there couldn’t be a better time to keep the faith and remain hopeful of the fact that 2021 will be a better year.

I am writing to those of us who, at the beginning of last year, had plans for businesses, careers and lives but feel broken and cheated after a year of disappointments. 
I am writing to those who are feeling like failures for not achieving those dreams they had set. To those who, now looking at their 2020 resolutions, feel a lump in their throat and a sharp pain in their chest because they couldn’t have been further off the mark. 
Lost opportunities
To the students who expected to go to the next level but Covid stole the year from them. To the families who, together at the start of last year, made plans to complete —or start—their dream homes, to travel or do a family project but Covid stole that opportunity.

googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");

To those who lost businesses, jobs and opportunities. To the families who lost their loved ones this year, the most heart-wrenching pain a human being could ever experience, this is for you: That even when it is more practical to remain skeptical and pessimistic of 2021, we must never let go of those great ideas, plans and dreams we had for 2020.
To those who feel like failures for hardly getting anything done in 2020, the fact that you are still alive, that you can read this, is reason enough to be grateful and hopeful. That you are still breathing means there is still a lot fight left in you because there is no greater gift than the gift of life.
I know while many of us publicly denounce new year’s resolutions, deep down we list the things we must achieve at the beginning of the new year. Conventional resolutions have been to get fitter, read more, do better at work and school and get closer to God and family.
However, I encourage you to make an exception this new year. On top of your usual resolutions, include the most important one: to keep the faith and remain optimistic.
