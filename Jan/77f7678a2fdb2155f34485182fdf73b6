Newly-appointed Nakuru Level Five Hospital Medical Superintendent, Dr Aisha Maina, has officially taken over leadership of the largest referral facility in the South Rift.
Dr Joseph Mburu handed the office over to her on Wednesday afternoon at a brief ceremony led by the county’s Medical Health Services Chief Officer, Dr Solomon Sirma.

"Dr Maina brings a wealth of experience as a seasoned dental specialist with an outstanding performance record, having worked at the hospital as the deputy medical superintendent,” Dr Sirma said.
“The changes are aimed at ensuring provision of quality and affordable services to all residents.”
Dr Mburu is a seasoned medic but he was demoted last week and posted to Molo Sub-County Hospital, where he will serve as a radiologist.
This came days after he announced that he would vie for the Nakuru senator's post in the 2022 General Election.





Service improvement
The county’s health services department, in a letter signed by Dr Solomon Sirma, effected the transfers of at least eight other doctors.
The department defended its decision, saying it was aimed at improving service delivery.
Dr Mburu is credited with transforming Naivasha Sub-County Hospital to one of the best facilities in the region after taking over as its boss.
A below-par hospital prior to his tenure, he oversaw several changes, including construction of a maternity wing that saw the number of deliveries increase from 400 to 600 a month.
Dr Mburu also ensured improved sanitation at the facility, which became one of the cleanest in the area.

Over the course of his career as an administrator, his leadership style endeared him to many as he also streamlined collection of cash within the hospital.
His successes saw him poached by the new administration when Mr Lee Kinyanjui took over as governor in 2017.
Infrastructure upgrade
Meanwhile, Nakuru has been implementing a Sh1 billion health infrastructure upgrade project that touches on facilities across the county.
The county has been revamping health facilities built by Mr Kinyanjui’s predecessor, Mr Kinuthia Mbugua, between 2013-2017 but which remained idle for years.
It has been investing heavily in the health sector, additionally constructing facilities in rural and far-flung areas of the region to ease congestion at Nakuru Level Five Hospital.
Nakuru has 459 public and private health facilities spread across the county.
Fourteen are level four and five hospitals, 22 health centres, 187 dispensaries and 249 community units offering level one health services.
The county has only one level five hospital that serves as a referral facility for counties including Nakuru, Kericho, Baringo, Nyandarua, Samburu and Narok. At least 60 doctors have left to pursue advanced studies. They want permanent employment terms, six-month salaries and proper personal protective equipment. According to family members, the deceased was attached to the DP’s security detail for several years. The footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020.
