Concerns about partisanship or sloppiness by the elections referee won’t be limited to its critics in the opposition, though.Anyone who cares about free, fair and peaceful elections in Kenya in 2022 needs to call the commission out. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) survived the last three months of 2020 with its back on the wall, as opposition leader Raila Odinga pushed for its disbandment.
Part of Mr Odinga’s grievance was the commission’s proposed budget for the planned constitutional referendum later this year, which he believed was deliberately inflated to make the plebiscite look too expensive for the country to hold.

});
}, 62000);
}



The ODM party leader, who is a co-architect of the constitutional changes alongside President Uhuru Kenyatta, was particularly unsettled by the fact that the Sh14 billion the IEBC had quoted was being used by the opponents of the referendum to try to scupper it.
The electoral agency appeared to buy itself some breathing space when it last month scaled down its budget for the verification of endorsement signatures for the referendum Bill from Sh241 million to Sh93 million

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Then, it did the unthinkable last Thursday. A tweet on its official Twitter handle on the day it launched the signature verification labelled the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the reforms process that culminated in the proposed referendum, the ‘Burning Bridges Initiative’.
The tweet was deleted moments later, and the IEBC sought to explain it away as a typographical error.
Unfortunate tweet
But given the tweet’s echoing a familiar line of attack against BBI by the ruling Jubilee Party faction allied to Deputy President William Ruto, it is unlikely that the people who have been baying for the IEBC’s blood saw it as anything other than partisan.
With that unfortunate tweet, the Wafula Chebukati-led commission effectively sent out a ‘come and have me disbanded’ message to its haters in the opposition.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



And having smelled blood, they’ll sure come! It’s a question of when, not if.
Other than the referendum campaigns, the toughest political battles in Kenya this year are likely to be fought over IEBC.
Concerns about partisanship or sloppiness by the elections referee won’t be limited to its critics in the opposition, though.
Anyone who cares about free, fair and peaceful elections in Kenya in 2022 needs to call the commission out.
The bungling of the last presidential election by the IEBC was blamed for the nullification of its outcome by the Supreme Court and the tensions that engulfed the country in the months after that decision.
The judges criticised the IEBC for sloppiness, noting that the commission didn’t have all the vote tallying forms when they announced the results and that some forms lacked security features such as watermarks, signatures or serial numbers.
To inspire public confidence that it will perform better in 2022, the agency needs to prove it can get things right this time around.
There is zero chance it will win the much-needed public confidence by getting a simple tweet about the BBI wrong or showing outright partisanship. Or what do they smoke over there?
