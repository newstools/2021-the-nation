Residents who responded to distress calls managed to retrieve her and was rushed to Rongo Sub County Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.
“She has been involved in a series of gold excavations in this area. They move as a group, sometimes by the river banks in search of alluvial gold,” local resident Joseph Obiero said.
According to Kanyasrega Assistant Chief Ezekiel Kokeyo, the woman was part of a group involved in a mining spree at derelict mines in North East Sakwa location.





Her body was taken to Rosewood Hospital.
“We have warned residents to avoid old mines especially during the rainy seasons. Henceforth, we have put measures in place to comb those visiting old mines and anyone found at the sites will face the due legal process,” said Mr Kokeyo. Walter Onyango, Ben Owino and Fredrick Otieno were taken to Migori hospital. Only one of the bodies had been retrieved by Wednesday noon.
