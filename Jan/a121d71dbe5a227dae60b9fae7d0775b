Busy window
Record champions Gor Mahia was one of the teams which was active in the primary transfer window which ended in November 2 2020, acquiring a record 14 players.





K'Ogalo have already lost former Nairobi City Stars custodian Levis Opiyo who was among players signed in the last transfer window. Opiyo  terminated his services two weeks ago  due to non payment of salaries.
Gor then roped in Ugandan born South Sudanese striker Tito Okello, Burundian Jules Ulimwengu, Cameroon import Betrand Konfor and Benson Omala from Western Stima.
Some other notable transfer were Lawrence Juma from Gor Mahia to 2009 champions Sofapaka, Michael Kibwage from KCB to 'Batoto ba Mungu' and Boniface Omondi from Gor Mahia to moneybags Wazito.
Wazito also bagged evergreen Kevin Kimani from Mathare United as well as midfield maestro Fidel Origa from Western Stima.
Others were AFC Leopards acquisition of Harrison Mwendwa from Kariobangi Sharks and Peter Thiong'o from Kakamega Homeboyz.

Veteran striker Stephen Waruru also hit the headlines by joining newly promoted Bidco United while Cercidy 'Carrick' Okeyo left Sofapaka for 2008 champions Mathare United.  President Trump has left the White House and President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn shortly as the 46th President of the United States. Outgoing US leader, who refused to accept his defeat for more than two months, never congratulated Biden on his victory. Donald Trump will snub Biden by not attending the inauguration ceremony.
