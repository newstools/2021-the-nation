The last Kenyan World Championships gold in the 25-lap race came 20 years ago through Charles Kamathi.World half marathon record holder says he’s shifting from the road to the track. World half marathon record holder Kibiwott Kandie is irked by Kenya’s 20-year 10,000 metres track gold medal drought and is taking the bull by the horns.
Fresh from breaking the 21-kilometre world record, Kandie has declared he is shifting gears lower and going for the gold in the 25-lap race at the Tokyo Olympics. Kenya hasn’t won an Olympic gold in the 10,000m since Naftali Temu panned one at the 1968 Munich Olympics.

The last Kenyan World Championships gold in the 10,000m came 20 years ago when Charles Kamathi outwitted Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie to win the title in Edmonton.
Kandie will have none of that and has vowed to break the jinx at the Tokyo Games in July.
Build-up towards the trials
The 24-year-old soldier improved the world record by 29 seconds during the Valencia Half Marathon last December after timing 57 minutes and 32 seconds, lowering compatriot Geoffrey Kamworor’s time of 58:01.

Kandie who has been training in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County, and assures that his preparations for the Olympics Games have started and he will be using various races as part of his build-up towards the national trials where he hopes to be selected.
“I have never competed in track events and this year I will be looking forward to competing in the Olympics Games in the 10,000m race.
“It has taken a long time for Kenya’s flag to be hoisted and I think it has reached a time where the national anthem has to be played after the victory this year,” vowed Kandie.
The soldier further revealed that he compete at the Kenya Defence Forces Cross Country Championships slated on 29 where he wants to retain his title. “I have a number of races to participate in this season and I have been preparing for the KDF Cross Country Championships which will kick start my season. I took a break and I’m back getting ready for the various events and my season has been good so far,” he said.

Kandie will also be lining up for the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon on February 19, where he is expected to defend his title.
He started the season last year with a win in RAK Half Marathon after clocking 58:58 beating his compatriot Alexander Munyao to second place in 59:16 while Ethiopia’s Mule Wasihun was third in 59:47.
There have been various discussions lately in the athletics circles on the elusive 10,000m gold. Athletics Kenya President Jack Tuwei last week revealed that this year things will be different in terms of selecting a team that will represent Kenya in the Olympics Games in the distance.
“We have to break the traditions this year of just selecting athletes during the National trials for the games. As a federation, we shall select a number of probable athletes who will be in a camp before they compete during the trials,” revealed Tuwei.
