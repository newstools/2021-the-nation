Mr Mwaura says his newfound political allegiance to DP Ruto is a result of listening to the people at the grassroots.The senator said Kenyans should be prepared for more defections from Jubilee party to Ruto's faction. Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura has defended his move to support Deputy President William Ruto, saying he has done so to save his political career.
The senator had been one of the fierce critics of Dr Ruto, accusing him of sabotaging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s development agenda.
But yesterday, Mr Mwaura told the Sunday Nation on phone that his newfound political allegiance to DP Ruto is a result of listening to the people at the grassroots, especially in Mt Kenya, who are supporting Mr Ruto’s bid for presidency next year.

“By the end of the day these things you do not do them because of anybody, you do them because of your own personal survival,” said Mr Mwaura.
“My ears are on the ground and the ground is supporting Mr Ruto,” added Mr Mwaura.
He noted that in supporting Mr Ruto, he is honouring his part as a leader and as a member of Jubilee Party that agreed that President Uhuru Kenyatta should serve for 10 years and then support Mr Ruto for another 10.





“We honoured him by what he deserved.As a Jubilee Party, we said Uhuru Kenyatta should serve his two terms and Mr Ruto for two terms. What I am doing is honouring my promise as a Jubilee party member,” said Mr Mwaura.
Political oblivion
The senator said Kenyans should be prepared for more defections from Jubilee party to deputy president’s side saying Mr Ruto has strong attachment at the grassroots and leaders are only shifting their political allegiance ‘because that is what most of people are asking them to do’.
Mr Mwaura was saved from political oblivion by President Kenyatta after he lost to Mr Simon King’ara, the current MP for Ruiru in Kiambu County in nominations. He was later nominated to the Senate.
Mr Mwaura had quit ODM and joined Jubilee to vie in Ruiru. The senator says he has no problem with Mr Kenyatta.

Last year in an interview with a local television, Mr Mwaura said Jubilee is in shambles because of internal divisions.
“It is clear that Jubilee is divided into two parts and the party is over. We are just hanging by bootstraps,” Mr Mwaura said during the interview. This is the clearest indication yet that they are fed up with the ruling Jubilee Party after months of simmering tensions. Deputy President expresses confidence that his Jubilee faction will lead the next government. Education CS George Magoha says government will provide three million needy learners with masks. In most schools, lack of classrooms, desks, water, toilets, and dormitories is a stark reality. A new twist in the battle between DP Ruto and his political foe Gideon Moi, for control of vote-rich Rift Valley.
