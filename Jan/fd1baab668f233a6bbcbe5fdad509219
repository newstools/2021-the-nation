Governor Alfred Mutua’s Maendeleo Chap Chap party has received a huge boost ahead of the Machakos senatorial by-election after politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka endorsed the party’s candidate, Mr John Katuku.
Former Machakos woman rep Susan Musyoka and politician Joseph Mathuki endorsed the former Mwala MP, who served as water minister and finance assistant minister in President Mwai Kibaki’s administration.

Dr Musyoka, who had been elected on a Wiper ticket, said she had decided to jump onto Dr Mutua’s bandwagon after evaluating all the candidates.
“It is time for the people of Machakos to choose wisely. Mr Mutua Katuku is a seasoned politician and a great leader who believes in social justice and is a social democrat. We are going to have a leader who not only cares for the less fortunate, but also cares for women and the marginalised,” she said yesterday, echoing Mr Peter Mutulu, the county Orange democratic Movement (ODM) party chairman.

The multiple endorsements are seen as a major boost to Mr Katuku’s candidature and a setback especially to Ms Agnes Kavindu Muthama, the Wiper candidate, and Mr Urbanus Muthama Ngengele, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate in the March 18 by-election that has attracted 10 other aspirants.
The endorsements coincided with the start of the presentation of nomination papers to the Boundaries Commission (IEBC) offices in Machakos Town. Mr Katuku, Ms Kavindu and Mr Ngengele were among the nominees set to get clearance from the IEBC yesterday.
“I am very happy today to welcome Dr Musyoka and Mr Katuku,” Dr Mutua said at a brief ceremony in Mlolongo. The Wiper party is battling a fall out in its rank and file following the selection of Ms Kavindu, the ex-wife of former Machakos senator Johnstone Muthama. A retreat convened at Stoni Athi Resort in Mavoko on Friday to iron out outstanding issues ahead of the start of the campaigns instead exposed the simmering unease within the party.

MPs and MCAs who spoke at the meeting were reluctant to commit their money to sponsor Ms Kavindu.
The party also used the retreat to chastise a faction of at least 10 Machakos Wiper MCAs who have openly endorsed Mr Katuku.
The errant MCAs, who include former majority leader and Mua MCA Francis Ngunga, complained that Mr Musyoka imposed Ms Kavindu on them to settle a grudge against Mr Muthama.
“Wiper MCAs who are supporting candidates of other parties have gone against the Political Parties Act and risk being punished,” the party’s organising secretary, Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, told journalists. Katuku is vying for the county’s senate seat on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket. In 2017, Kavindu vied for the Machakos woman rep's seat on a Jubilee Party ticket. DP Ruto accused of coming up with new pledges without fulfilling earlier promises. A spot check by Nation on Tuesday found no signs of the cross slab.
