However, reports from Japan said Olunga left Reysol early on Sunday and was believed to be heading to Qatar to complete his transfer to Al-Duhail (formerly Lekhwiya SC). 
Michael Olunga's younger brother, Victor Ogada uploaded a photo of himself sitting in a room with framed pictures of Sheikhs in the background on his Instagram page on Monday night.
He captioned the photo ‘Doha’, which is Qatar’s capital, leading to suggestions that he had trailed his brother to the country to complete the transfer.
