The elections were initially planned for April 25 last year but were shelved due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Current officials were elected in 2016 under the 2013 Sports Act which introduced term limits.
Mumbo, a former player and founder of Vikapu Elite Basketball Academy and Sports Connect Africa, has served in the KBF Executive Committee.  
Otula, who is an executive committee member of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K), is a career teacher and the current chief principal of Sunshine School in Nairobi.

KBF’s First Vice Chairman Hilmi Ali,  Second Vice Chairman Donald Liru and Treasurer Peter Orero are all expected to retain their seats unopposed since they have no challengers.
Also expected to retain their positions are Fixtures Secretary Joseph Amoko and Assistant Fixtures Secretary Steven Nyakina, who are unopposed.
Assistant secretary general, Ambrose Kisoi, who was elevated to acting secretary general after Vitalis Gode resigned last year, will be confirmed to the position since no one has come out to challenge him.
Kenyan international Angela Luchivya is poised to become the new assistant secretary general as she is the only candidate for the post.
Assistant treasurer’s position has attracted three contestants - the incumbent Luke Ogola and his challengers Louise Araka and Nelly Odera.
