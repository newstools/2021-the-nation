 Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Tuesday launched bursaries worth Sh110 million which will benefit 40,000 needy secondary, college and university students in the county.
According to Ms Waiguru, the bursary cheques will be dispatched to parents in all the 20 wards so that they can take them to learning institutions.

During the function at the county headquarters in Kutus town, Ms Waiguru explained that the beneficiaries were well vetted by ward bursary committees to ensure transparency.
“We made sure only the most deserving cases benefited," she said.
She revealed that the bursaries will benefit 32,000 secondary school students and 8,000 university and college students, adding that the initiative is aimed at ensuring that the learners do not drop out of school.
“My government is committed to ensuring that all students access education," she said.





Take education seriously
The governor advised the beneficiaries to take education seriously now that they have been awarded bursaries by the county.
On the re-opening of schools amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Governor Waiguru urged school management teams in the county to ensure that all the laid-down prevention guidelines are complied with to protect learners from the coronavirus.
She also said her administration will be distributing about 140,000 masks in schools and water tanks to support the setting up of handwashing stations.
The governor said the county’s youth polytechnics have been equipped with resources to ensure the implementation of Covid-19 prevention guidelines which include setting up of adequate handwashing facilities.

});

}



Construction of additional classrooms to facilitate social distancing in the polytechnics has also been completed, she said.
Health guidelines
“The county’s department of health is working closely with all schools to offer guidance on Covid-19 and monitor implementation of health guidelines. All our schools have been assigned a health worker and a health facility to which any suspected case of Covid-19 should be reported,” she said.
She revealed that the county has so far recorded 484 Covid-19 cases with 441 recovering from the disease in hospitals while the rest are recovering under the home-based care programme. Seven people have, however, succumbed to the disease in the county.
Kirinyaga ward representatives thanked Governor Waiguru for releasing bursaries for the needy students whose parents have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Led by Kirinyaga County Assembly Majority Leader Kamau Murango, the MCAs said the bursaries had been given at the right time.
“Schools have re-opened and the needy learners will not be sent home,'' said Mr Murango.
Support from MCAs
The MCAs reiterated that they will work with Ms Waiguru for the growth of the county and the benefit of all residents.
“We buried the hatchet with the governor and we shall support her to deliver on her mandate," said Mr Murango.
