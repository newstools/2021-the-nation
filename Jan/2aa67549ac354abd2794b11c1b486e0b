Sombre mood engulfs Chemoe where the 30-year-old constable had served for more than two years.Tension high in the area with reports indicating that residents are fleeing their homes for fear of more attacks by criminals. In April last year, five police officers survived a tragic accident that saw seven of their colleagues drown in a raging Kagir River in Baringo North.
The 12 officers attached to the Anti-Stock Theft Unit based in banditry-prone Chemoe at the border of Baringo North and Tiaty sub-counties in Baringo County, were heading back to their camp from a security meeting at the county headquarters in Kabarnet when they got stuck in a seasonal river on April 29 at 8pm prompting them to disembark to push it out.

“They took several hours trying to push the vehicle out of the drift but they did not notice the increasing water levels following the heavy rainfall upstream. Unfortunately, seven of them were swept downstream while three managed to swim to safety,” said regional commander Marcus Ochola at the time.

Constable Patrick King’ori was among the lucky ones. The others were Joseph Omboye, Andrew Menisa, Cliff Nyakeniga and Bernard Sigei.
But on Thursday, Patrick King’ori’s luck ran out when he was shot by bandits while on patrol.
According to police reports, Mr King’ori and nine of his colleagues were fetching firewood on the way back to their station from patrol when they were attacked by bandits. He was shot in the stomach while trying to flee from the attackers.
Baringo North Sub-County Police Commander Fredrick Odinga said the injured officer was rushed to Marigat Sub-County Hospital but healthcare workers were on strike so he was transferred to Nakuru but died on the way.
A sombre mood engulfed the Chemoe where the 30-year-old constable had served for more than two years.
“It is sad that we lost him in the hands of armed criminals. The officer would have survived but he couldn’t find medical help,” said County Police Commander Robinson Ndiwa.

Fear of more attacks
Tension is high in the area with reports indicating that residents of Chemoe, Kagir and Yatya are fleeing their homes for fear of more attacks by criminals who are feared to be still lurking in the bushes. Mr Richard Chepchomei, a village elder, said locals have vowed to move out of the area.
“We fear for our lives and we cannot stay in such an area where our security is not guaranteed. If the bandits can attack officers who are armed then how sure are we of our safety? The situation has also been worsened after police reservists who used to help in repulsing criminals were disarmed by the government. We have now been left on our own at the volatile border,” said Mr Chepchomei.
“How many people should we bury for the government to act? They have been giving us empty promises of carrying out a massive disarmament to mop up illegal guns but it seems that was just a public relations exercise. It seems we are lesser Kenyans because security officers are only coming here to carry dead bodies,” he lamented.
Bartabwa MCA Reuben Chepsongol raised concerns over the security of the children who are expected to report back to school tomorrow.





“If this is the situation then how safe are our children now that even parents fear to go about their normal duties. We fear that learning will be paralysed in this region if no urgent measures are taken to tame the attacks,” he said.

He appealed to the government to deploy more officers in banditry hotspots so that learning would resume uninterrupted. Mr Odinga has however assured the locals of their security, noting that police officers have intensified patrols in the troubled area.
“Residents should not panic. We are sure that we will nab the culprits behind the attack,” said Mr Odinga. The incident occurred after the two had spent time together chewing miraa inside the trader’s car. Lucas Wema Muli was stoned to death barely 300 metres from their city home in Queen’s Court, Utawala. Education CS George Magoha says government will provide three million needy learners with masks. In most schools, lack of classrooms, desks, water, toilets, and dormitories is a stark reality. A new twist in the battle between DP Ruto and his political foe Gideon Moi, for control of vote-rich Rift Valley.
