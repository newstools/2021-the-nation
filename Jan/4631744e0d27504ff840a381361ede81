In a press conference on Sunday, the 26-year-old centre-forward asserted that everyone is ready for the Al Ahli confrontation in the Amir Cup.  
"We are waiting for an important and strong match, but we are ready for it and everyone is working hard to overcome this match and reach the next round of the competition." 
The Kenyan international continued, "I am at the coach's disposal in this match and I will be present to help my team in all the competitions I'm needed, and any match we will play in order to achieve victory."





Olunga, who scored 28 goals for Kashiwa on his way to emerging the 2020 J1 League Player of the Year and Golden Boot winner, concluded by saying he was happy at his new home.
"I played two matches with the team and the upcoming match will be my third. Football has no difference whether it was in Doha, Japan or any other country. The important element in it is adapting to the team and I am very happy to be with my new teammates."
