“Caf matches are the biggest in Africa and as a player it has always been my target to play in the group stage every season. It is always good to play against players and a team you are familiar with,” Owino told Nation Sport.
“Even though I am a Gor Mahia fan and former player, loyalty won’t count in February as I will fight for Napsa Stars to ensure we qualify for the group stages. We have very experienced players and I am confident we shall win in both legs and qualify for the group stage,” added Owino.

Owino, who signed a two-year contract with Napsa on Saturday after five years with Zesco United, played his first match for his new club over a the weekend, a 2-1 win against second placed Prison Leopards.
Interestingly, the 32-year-old defender trained with Gor until last week and will certainly have plenty of information to share with the Napsa technical bench.
Awino said he opted to remain in Zambia due to the stability of the country’s league and good remuneration.
“Players are really respected here in Zambia and many of them take football as a serious career. In Kenya there is a lot of politics in football and players lack of pay is the order of the day,” said Owino.
Napsa is also home to former Gor Mahia duo of striker Timothy Otieno and custodian Shabaan Odhonji, plus former Mathare United forward Andrew Tololwa.

Despite joining Napsa Stars during this January transfer window, Owino will be eligible to play in Africa since he had not featured for Zesco United on the continental scene this season.
The Ndola-based Zesco United, which also boasts of former AFC Leopards striker Johnmark Makwatta, Jesse Were and former Posta Rangers custodian Ian Otieno, didn’t qualify for Caf competitions this season after finishing fifth in the 18-table Zambian Super League.
Owino joined K'Ogalo in 2011 from former Kenyan Premier League side Karuturi Sport and won two league titles with the Kenyan giants. He takes over after the exit of 60-year-old Brazilian tactician Roberto Oliveira. He joins as a free agent having left Zesco United in December 2020. Allies want him to name his successor as region’s kingpin in order to tame Ruto’s growing influence in his political backyard. The ODM leader says Kenya is a multi-ethnic society, hence the need to be sensitive to the ethnic differences. Experts are concerned about the rapid spread of new variants of the virus.
