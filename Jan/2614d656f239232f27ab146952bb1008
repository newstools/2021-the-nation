“We have not been scoring goals and today we have scored two goals and this is good morale booster for us as we prepare to battle it out with KCB on Saturday,” said Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso.
Mathare United coach Salim Ali remains confident the team will learn from this defeat.
“Our defence was not up to standard today and we must work on it because we have now lost three games in a row and that is not good for a team like Mathare United. We hope to put our act together when we play Tusker in our next match,” said Ali.





Nyangweso's side were ahead in the seventh minute thanks to a goalmouth melee which resulted into an own goal with Mathare Job Ochieng unable to keep the ball out.
After this goal , he soldiers pressed for more goals but were let down by strikers Daniel Waweru, Michael Otieno Mark Bikokwa and Churchil Muloma who missed the target.
On resumption Ulinzi came back a more rejuvenated side and pressed for more goals and their efforts were rewarded in the 61st minute when Elvis Nandwa fired on top of the box after receiving a neat pass from second half substitute Oscar Wamalwa inside the danger zone.
Mathare United scored the goal of the match in the 89th minute when Daniel Otieno connected with a powerful volley past goalkeeper James Saruni to give the city lads their consolation goal.
