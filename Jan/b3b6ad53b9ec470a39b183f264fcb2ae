Sec 19 (2) provides for the election of two governors as the CoG’s chair and vice chair. The two can serve for a term of one year and are eligible for re-election another term of the same period.
Governor Wambora is the CoG’s fifth chair, after Isaac Ruto, Peter Munya, Josphat Nanok (Turkana), and Mr Oparanya (Kakamega), in that order.
