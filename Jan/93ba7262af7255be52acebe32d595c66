Dating life in Nairobi City
The first time he introduced “Nairobi” to the public, was during a virtual Blankets & Wine concert, last month where him, Zeshary Jean and Muthoni the Drummer Queen performed the song and left fans wanting for more.
The song “Nairobi’’ is straightforward, as it tends to paint a true picture of the dating life in Nairobi City and how everyone is sharing his/her partner with other people without knowing. This is how it is denoted in the song, “Na hii Nairobi si sahani, ni sinia”
“Nairobi” was written by Bensoul, Bien-Aimé Baraza and Mejja while its audio was produced by So Fresh 254, Bensoul and Savara.

Spice up the tune
Then who better than Mejja to come in and spice up the tune with his lyrics. This was the actual highlight of the song. His part aroused different opinions from the fan base at large, with most of them being negative. But hey, in music is the only place where there are no rules. “What Mejja did was to express himself fully, in the song and that was what I wanted him to do. He brought out the new cultural genge notion to this amazing soulful jam,” said Bensoul at one of his interviews.
