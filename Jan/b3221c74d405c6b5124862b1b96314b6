The biggest sensation of the festive season has to have been Senator Irungu Kang’ata’s letter discussing the bleakish prospects of the Building Bridges Initiative, BBI, in the Mt Kenya region.
Several reasons were cited for the weakly flickering performance of an initiative backed by the full strength of state power. Two stood out as particularly concerning. First, the legislator took issue with the use of the provincial administration (and other forms of hard tactics) in BBI mobilisation, which is “an example of government using its hard power to force its citizens to endorse BBI”.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Second, Kang’ata decried the government’s dismal performance in spreading the gospel of BBI, because, to use his expression, “in comparison, government’s narrative in the region, including BBI, is being sold by civil servants with limited political skills.”

});
}, 62000);
}



There are many who think that our politicians are incapable of subtlety and finesse in any shape or form. They are woefully mistaken.
Criticisms
What Mheshimiwa meant in that most decorous of criticisms is that the state machinery deployed to popularise the BBI has terrorised Kenyans and otherwise comported itself in such odious and tyrannical ways, Kenyans were all but ready to consign the proposals to the dustbin if a referendum were held. He also meant to say that introducing civil servants into competitive or contested political activity is not only singularly unwise, it guarantees spectacularly disastrous outcomes.
Ideally, civil servants are required to scrupulously signal political neutrality, and cultivate public confidence on their impartiality at all times. Civil servants are trained to be deliberately staid, to eschew drama and flee controversy at all costs.
Government authority considerably depends on the credibility of its public servants, who must embody the gravity of their office and the solemnity of the service.

 Kenyans are grievously afflicted by a recent unfortunate turn in our public affairs. It is now commonplace for civil servants to engage in partisan political competition. It is also normal for them to be boastful, arrogant and menacing, as though doing their best to undermine government agenda in the name of advancing it.
A number of them are considered active contenders for various national and devolved elective positions, and have not been shy in displaying their campaign assets.
Legitimacy
Consequently, the effectiveness, legitimacy and credibility of government has taken a severe beating.
Many Kenyans neither consider nor expect the civil service to be fair, impartial or neutral in its undertakings. In addition to the sorry blemishes of tribalism, nepotism and runaway graft, shameless politicking is the latest blight.
Vital public services like the administration of law and order, provision of security, implementation of development projects and disbursement of public resources are no longer deemed to be fairly arbitrated by disinterested servants of the people. Instead, they are viewed to be rewards or punishments meted out on the basis of favouritism or vindictiveness.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Aside from active political canvassing, many of them seem to be sadists who delight in threatening, mocking, abusing and terrorising their fellows as well as members of the public.

googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-3");

});
}, 62000);
}



Nowadays, few government projects proceed without the obligatory demolition, arson, cruel displacement of vulnerable people in desperately inclement weather and the liberal deployment of savage violence on fellow citizens.
Clearly, considerations like adequate notice, provision of alternative amenities and humane treatment are foreign to government thinking.
These civil servants are supposed to persuade Kenyans to support BBI, or to trust that the Huduma Namba is not some diabolical subterfuge, or that the draconian pandemic containment measures are actually in their interest.
Crackdown
This cohort of brash, swaggering and sneering civil servants fills Kenyans with dread. Every way a citizen turns, there is a deadline, or ban, or ultimatum that constrains her agency and limits her freedom.
The preferred vocabulary of contemporary public service bristles with “Starting today... mpende msipende…” and the all-time favourite: “…failure to which…”
It is a lamentable inventory of crackdowns (by multi-agency teams, of course), marufuku and every manner of dire administrative injustice.
Without a doubt, the clique of swashbuckling bureaucrats consider haunting Kenyans to be the stuff of government, and publicly relish their unpleasantness.

Regardless of what the law says, they are wholly unrestrained in their repressive crusade.
There is an urgent need to investigate the working environment which seems to create incentives for civil servants to become sordid political actors. Perhaps the feedback system is only an echo chamber where perversity is reinforced and privileged.
In any event, as Kang’ata pointed out, civil servants should not be propagating partisan political agendas. They are hopeless at it, and may be counted on to do irreparable damage, not only to the credibility and effectiveness of the service, but to their ill-fated political projects as well.

The privileges and immunities of the civil service must not afford any single officer any measure of impunity in political adventure. Social media giant cites the risk of further violence following the assault on the US Capitol by his supporters During his four years in office, Trump used Twitter to ridicule his political opponents, labelling them with mocking nicknames. This comes after his repeated rejection of the election result and violent protests by his supporters.
