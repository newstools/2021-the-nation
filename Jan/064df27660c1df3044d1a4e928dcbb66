In 2019, Parliament tried to stop ballooning debt at Sh9 trillion with a ceiling but, since Kenya is in a deep hole and can only dig itself deeper into the pit, the ceiling is about to be breached and now Treasury wants it moved to Sh12 trillion. 

Recovery strategy 

In the economic recovery strategy set out by the National Treasury, it will seek to push wealthy countries and multilateral lenders like the World Bank to cancel part of it ballooning public debt. 

Kenya has also committed to seek from other bilateral official creditors a debt service treatment that is in line with the agreed terms of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) of the G20 group of rich nations and big emerging powers. 

Treasury says Kenya will also rely more on loans arranged from multilateral bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund since they carry friendly terms with low rates and longer repayment periods.

These loans however come with conditions including structural adjustments programmes, high taxes and cut back on subsidies.
