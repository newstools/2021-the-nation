Deputy President William Ruto’s camp is gearing up for a bruising political battle with that of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula’s Ford-Kenya party in the upcoming Kabuchai constituency by-election in March.
Already, seven aspirants have declared their interest in contesting the seat but the duel has narrowed down to Mr Majimbo Kalasinga, who is allied to Mr Wetangula, and Mr Evans Kakai believed to be a Ruto ally.

The Ford Kenya leader has already endorsed Mr Kalasinga and forwarded his details to the Independent and Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
The party has recently undergone a supremacy battle for control, pitting Senator Wetangula and a group led by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati, especially in its Bungoma County stronghold.





Since the wrangles began, Mr Wetangula has maintained that he has had the party in his grip for the past nine years after taking over from former Local Government minister Musikari Kombo. Attempts to remove him have been dimmed by a rather slow and lengthy court process.
Pundits opine that voters are going to experience political changes and alignments. Some have observed that the DP is likely going to shape the politics in forthcoming by-elections in Matungu and Kabuchai if the recent Msambweni by-election result is anything to go by.
The by-election arose from the death of the area MP James Lusweti who was buried on December 19.
Biggest test
Mr Kalasinga, who vied for the seat in 2017, emerged third while independent candidate Tale Nabangi, now deceased, came second.
After endorsing Mr Kakai as his candidate, Dr Ruto is likely to court Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and his brigade owing to the rife political difference between the governor and Mr Wetang’ula in Ford Kenya.

It should be noted that the by-election in Kabuchai will either revive Mr Wetang’ula’s political star or sink it to oblivion. Kabuchai is the home of Senator Wetang’ula, Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga and Governor Wangamati.
The Kabuchai scenario presents the biggest test for Ford-Kenya and the greatest challenge to Senator Wetang’ula, for whom victory would send a strong message that he is still in charge of the party.
Mr Isaack Wanjekeche, a political analyst, says that the national attention of the Kabuchai race will attract the interest of many players including Dr Ruto and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga.
“Another test that Ford Kenya party is likely to face is that the nominee will need a party certificate signed by both the party leader and the secretary-general, both of whom do not see eye-to-eye,” said Mr Wanjekeche.
'Hustler' candidate
Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa on Friday told the Nation that the Tangatanga camp is preparing to field a ‘hustler’ candidate.

“Just the way we are set to support our own in Nairobi, the same will happen in both Kabuchai and Matungu,” said Mr Barasa. Already, Dr Juma Mukhwana has pulled out of the race on claims that the Ford Kenya nominations was not free and fair.

“I was a top contestant for the Kabuchai parliamentary seat in 2013, but I have however pulled out of the by election,” Dr Mukhwana told the Saturday Nation. He claimed that the party leadership wants to pick somebody whom they can micromanage and not a “development-conscious leader” like him.
“I cannot be duped to keep waiting for the nominations to take place in Ford Kenya, claims are rife that already Kalasinga has been nominated and has the certificate,” he said.
Dr Mukhwana vied for the Bungoma senatorial seat on a Jubilee ticket in 2017 and came second to Mr Wetang’ula.
At the same time, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi (Amani National Congress) has called on DP Ruto not to support a candidate in the by-elections in Matungu and Kabuchai “in the spirit of the Handshake”.
According to Mr Agoi, the DP will be going against his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, and Jubilee Party, which has not fielded a candidate.
“The DP is the principal assistant to the President and it will be a bad show if he goes against the party position by supporting a candidate,” said Mr Agoi, who spoke during his sister’s husband’s funeral in Eldoret on Wednesday.
Additional reporting by Wycliffe Kipsang Deputy President expresses confidence that his Jubilee faction will lead the next government. What apparently infuriated the ANC boss was what appeared to be an ultimatum for him and Mr Wetang'ula. Drama ensued early Saturday when the Kanu chair went to Kapsisiywa for coronation as the Kalenjin kingpin. Clinical officers agree to go back to work as more discussions take place, joining doctors who were first to return to work. In the coming months, the “Ruto parties” will avail themselves of a chance to show their mettle.
