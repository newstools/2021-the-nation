They also alleged that structures of some powerful people had been spared.
But acting City Manager Abala Wanga maintained that all the restructuring operations are meant for the envisaged development of the city as contained in Governor Peter Anyang’ Nyong’o’s development agenda.
“We appeal to Kisumu residents, especially traders ,to ignore a few people politicising the city restructuring operations. Some of these politicians don’t mean well for the progress of this county and have even been using money to incite some traders to stage demonstrations,” Mr Wanga said.

On top of sewer lines
Mr Wanga said some of the structures had been built on top of sewer lines and road reserves, giving an example of estates like Migosi. 
However, he noted that the demolition of the business kiosks has been suspended until Uhuru Business Park Complex, which is under construction, gets ready for occupation by the affected traders.
The city manager also indicated that the traders are being registered and will be given first priority at the Uhuru Business Park, which has a capacity of almost 10,000 ultra-modern stalls.

He also warned county staff who have allocated themselves stalls at Chichwa market, ordering them to surrender them within a week for re-allocation to needy traders, or face disciplinary action.Traders who acquired more than one stall at Chichwa Market have also been directed to urgently surrender the excess, and adhere to the 'One trader, one stall policy'.“The county government values the traders and will do everything at its disposal to ensure they get alternative places to do business,” Mr Wanga said. The county administration, led by Governor Nyong’o, has also directed its attention to recovery of grabbed land in the county. It’s targeting 52 illegally acquired pieces of land.The city manager noted that some of the land parcels had been earmarked for public institutions and parking areas.“Currently, the county is in the process of recovering six of the plots. Four cases are in court. We wish to notify the public that the recovery process is three-pronged,” Mr Wanga said.Buildings on pathways, playgrounds and wetlands will be demolished after notices issued to owners expire.   Work had already started at more than 11 feeder ports on Lake Victoria but the activities later went silent.
