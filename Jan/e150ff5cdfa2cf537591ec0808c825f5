“We have had conversations with contacts in various teams and universities who are willing to consider the athletes we select. The agreement is that we have to provide them with top quality athletes,” said Carew, adding that they are in talks with a number of local football clubs, with a view to consider some of the players who will be selected.
The girls’ program will take place from February 13 to March 12.
Football is the second discipline, in which Tusk Sports is seeking to provide opportunities for athletes after basketball last year.
The non-governmental organisation started the initiative with a men’s basketball trial between September and October last year, with more than 200 players between the age of 15 and 17 showing up, to try their luck.

According to Tusk Sports Coordinator Deng Garang, who was in charge of the basketball program, out of the 15 finalists (11 South Sudanese and 4 Kenyans), three have already landed scholarship opportunities at various universities in the United States of America.
They are 17-year-old Mathok Guot (Saint Louis University, Missouri), Xavier Yamo, 17, (Danville Christian Academy, Kentucky) and Ariik Kual, 16, (Capistrano Valley Christian School).
In the girl’s trial which took place between November and December, one girl out of the 15 finalists – Madina Okot has also landed a full scholarship opportunity at Saint Louis University in Missouri.
Garang expressed confidence that the organisation will find places for the remaining finalists since they are in talks with various institutions. Politicians led by Johnson Muthama, Susan Kihika and Kipchumba Murkomen say they have found peace and equality. The investigations have been narrowed down to close family members as well as the extended family.
