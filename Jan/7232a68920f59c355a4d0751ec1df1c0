Kisangani

Up to 25 people are feared to have died when a barge sank on the Congo River, authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo's northeastern province of Tshopo said on Tuesday.
"A barge which was leaving Kisangani for Basoko sank on Friday evening. The toll today is six bodies which have been recovered, 237 survivors and 19 missing," Tshopo's vice governor, Maurice Abibu Sakapela, told AFP.

"The public prosecutor has opened an inquiry. Some people have already been arrested," he said, blaming "overloading and the poor state of the vessel" for the accident.
Rivers and waterways are widely used for travel in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the absence of paved roads and railways.
But many vessels are old or poorly maintained and skippers may turn a blind eye to rules on lading and safety, despite requirements passed in April 2019 for all passengers to wear life jackets. President Felix Tshisekedi declares a day of mourning. Sixteen people survived the accident by swimming to safety on the Lukenye river. The new coronavirus strain identified in South Africa appears to be more transmissible than earlier variants. Several Ugandans said they could only access some social media platforms through a VPN. The Musalia Mudavadi-led party says it has already crafted articles of impeachment against the deputy president should he fail to resign.
