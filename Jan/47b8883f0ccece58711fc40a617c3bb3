Contract details of Mutamba’s move to Asswehly SC in Libya have not been disclosed, but Nation Sport understands that he will be at the Misrata-based side for one season.
“I want to thank Bidco in a special way because we had greater plans this season and they really helped me in all this. They made everything easy for me and I want to wish them the best in the season. They have a good group and a good coach and I know they will do well,” Mutamba said.





Asswehly confirmed acquiring the services of Mutamba by posting a photo of him in their red and white jersey on their website accompanied with the message, “Asswehly SC is pleased to announce the signing of Pistone Mutamba.”
Lwanga said they are eyeing players from fellow Premier League sides. “Apart from two strikers with Premier League experience, we are also targeting a midfielder and two stoppers. We don’t have a problem in the goalkeeping department,” explained the former Kenyan international.
Regarding Bidco’s latest performance in the Premier League, Lwanga said fatigue played a big role in the loss 2-0 at the hands of hosts Kakamega Homeboyz.
“Normally, the trip from Nairobi to Kakamega is six hours, but our bus broke down and we spent longer on the road than expected. Signs of fatigue were evident as within the first 20 minutes, we were two-nil down, with both goals coming in a span of five minutes,” he noted.
