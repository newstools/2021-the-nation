Addis Ababa
The United Nations says it has received "disturbing" reports of sexual violence and abuse in Ethiopia's conflict-hit Tigray region, including of individuals forced to rape members of their own family.
Pramila Patten, the UN's special representative on sexual violence in conflict, said she was greatly concerned by serious allegations from the northern region, including "a high number of alleged rapes" in the Tigray'sÂ capital, Mekele.

"There are also disturbing reports of individuals allegedly forced to rape members of their own family, under threats of imminent violence," Patten said in a statement on Thursday.
"Some women have also reportedly been forced by military elements to have sex in exchange for basic commodities."
Patten called on all parties involved in the hostilities to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for crimes of sexual violence.





Military operations
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, announced military operations in Tigray in early November, saying they came in response to attacks by the regional ruling party on federal army camps.
Abiy declared victory after federal forces entered the regional capital in late November, though leaders of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) remain on the run and have vowed to fight on.
Thousands have died in the conflict, according to the International Crisis Group, though a communications blackout and media and humanitarian access restrictions have made it difficult to assess the situation on the ground.
Emergency contraception
In her statement on Thursday, Patten noted that "medical centres have indicated an increase in the demand for emergency contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which is often an indicator of sexual violence in conflict".

She called for full humanitarian access to Tigray, including camps for displaced people "and refugee camps where new arrivals have allegedly reported cases of sexual violence".
She voiced concern about "more than 5,000 Eritrean refugees in and around the area of Shire living in dire conditions, many of them reportedly sleeping in an open field with no water or food, as well as the more than 59,000 Ethiopians who have fled the country into neighbouring Sudan".
The caretaker administration in Tigray did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month state television broadcast footage of a meeting during which an unidentified man in a military uniform expressed concern about rapes in Mekele.
"Why are women being raped in Mekele city?" the man said.
"It wouldn't be shocking had it been happening during the war, because it is not manageable so it could be expected. But at this moment while federal police and local police are back in town, it is still happening." N humanitarian assessment dated January 6 says Tigray remains "volatile" with "localised fighting". Majority of health facilities in the region have been destroyed or looted during the conflict. The officers who had tear gas confiscated the group's placards before protest activities began at Jeevanjee Gardens. The two properties were purchased through the funds suspected to be proceeds of crime and corruption. Isiolo Senator Dullo, the only PDR lawmaker, insists she was not consulted on changing the party name.
