Another senior security officer was on Thursday gunned down at Kapedo bridge on the boarder of Baringo-Turkana counties by suspected armed bandits.
Rift Valley Regional Coordinator George Natembeya said the chief inspector of police was on his way to Kapendo camp after burying his mother when he was attacked and killed by bandits alongside his driver.

Mr Natembeya said a third person in the vehicle, a civilian who had hitched a ride, survived the attack.
The regional boss said the inspector had planned to join a convoy of vehicles on his way back to work, but he went ahead and left others behind.
“Security vehicles were in Marigat to collect food and the inspector, who is in-charge of Kapedo and Lomelo camps, decided to leave early not knowing that he was being waited by bandits,” he said.
Tension is high in Kapedo following the attack and locals are living in fear of more attacks from the bandits who are reported to be hiding in the bush.

} Authorities said the victims are yet to the identified. Six bullet-riddled bodies were Tuesday discovered in a thicket by security personnel and locals pursuing bandits. The officers who had tear gas confiscated the group's placards before protest activities began at Jeevanjee Gardens. The two properties were purchased through the funds suspected to be proceeds of crime and corruption.
