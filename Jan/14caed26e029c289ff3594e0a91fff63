This will be the fourth challenge against the President who has been in power since 1986, the previous occasions being 2001, 2006 and 2016. Mr Kyagulanyi’s lawyers are racing against time because the law gives an aggrieved candidate a maximum of 15 days after the results have been released to file a petition.  National Unity Platform (NUP) party leader Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, has notified the Supreme Court that he will file a petition on Monday challenging the re-election of President Yoweri Museveni.
This will be the fourth challenge against the President who has been in power since 1986, the previous occasions being 2001, 2006 and 2016.

Commenting about the development, Judiciary spokesperson Jameson Karemani said, “It is true that Mr Kyagulanyi’s lawyers had written to the court to allow them to file their petition today (Saturday) but the Chief Justice advised that they file it on Monday.”
Time factor
Mr Kyagulanyi’s lawyers are racing against time because the law gives an aggrieved candidate a maximum of 15 days after the results have been released to file a petition. 
The results were declared on January 16, meaning the 15 days expire on Sunday, but since it is a weekend, the Chief Justice has allowed the filing of the petition on Monday.

Mr Kyagulanyi disputes the results that the Electoral Commission (EC) has published, showing that President Museveni was re-elected with 58.38 per cent of the votes in the January 14 polls. 
He came second with 35.08 per cent while the rest of the votes were shared by the remaining nine candidates. 
Decision to go to court
The matter of whether or not to challenge the election result in court has been a contentious one within Mr Kyagulanyi’s camp, with some saying it is a waste of time and that they don’t expect the Supreme Court, which has not annulled any of Mr Museveni’s three victories that were challenged in the past, will do so this time round.

In 2001 and 2006, Dr Kizza Besigye challenged Mr Museveni’s victories and lost narrowly – two to three in the first one, and three to four in the second.
The main issue was that whereas a number of election irregularities were proved, the petitioner could not convince majority of the justices that the extent of rigging substantially affected the results. 
Mr Museveni had it much easier in 2016 when Mr Amama Mbabazi challenged his re-election, with all nine justices ruling to uphold the outcome. 
On that occasion, Mr Mbabazi came a distant third.
Dr Besigye - who had been Mr Museveni’s biggest challenger in the election – was locked up in his home and rendered unable to move and put together a petition.
He said the thought crossed his mind despite repeatedly declaring in the past that he would never return to court to challenge Mr Museveni’s re-election.
Here is the list of judges from which the panel to determine Mr Kyagulanyi’s petition will be selected, as well as their short profiles.
Justice Faith Mwondha
Justice Faith Mwondha was a magistrate before she became a delegate in the Constituent Assembly, and also served as a commissioner at the Uganda Human Rights Commission. 
She was first appointed judge of the High Court in 2001 and four years later was designated as the Inspector General of Government (IGG), a position she held for a decade before returning to the Judiciary and eventually rising to the Supreme Court.

});
}, 62000);
}








During the hearing of the appeal on the presidential age limit case in 2018, Justice Mwonda raised dust when she pointed out that whereas she was not among the seven judges who former Chief Justice Katureebe had assigned to hear the appeal, honoraria [a payment given for professional services that are rendered nominally without charge] had been budgeted for her and three other colleagues who were also not on the case.  She was on the panel that upheld the victory of Preident Museveni in 2016. 
If named onto the panel, this will be her second shot.
