Mr Chebukati stressed that the publication of names of persons contesting in party primaries and those intending to contest as independent candidates is not “clearance of candidates to contest in an election.” The electoral commission is set to gazette at least 18 names of persons who have expressed interest in the Nairobi gubernatorial race.
The list, according to impeccable sources at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), has 13 independent aspirants -- including former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu -- and five hopefuls from the Jubilee party.

Apart from Mr Waititu, the independents, who analysts describe as ‘political novices’ include Raymond Ndung'u, Njau Luingi, Evans Machoka, David Lingala, Jimal Ibrahim and former National Assembly speaker candidate Dr Noah Winja.
Others are, Alloys Otieno, Mathenge Mukundi, Yassin Munyanya, Timothy Olong'o, Phyllis Wangari and Augustine Kavindu.
The five aspirants from Jubilee party are Dennis Waweru, Anne Kagure, Betty Adhiambo, Alex Kipchirchir and Omar Kongo.

In a statement on Monday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said section 32 and 33 of the Elections Act 2011 provide that persons intending to contest as independent candidates shall submit to the commission symbols they intend to use in an election.
“The commission in turn is required to publish in the Kenya Gazette the names and symbols of the persons,” he said.
The IEBC chairman noted that the names and symbols of the aspirants have been forwarded to the Government Printer for publication.
Mr Chebukati stressed that the publication of names of persons contesting in party primaries and those intending to contest as independent candidates is not “clearance of candidates to contest in an election.”
“Clearance of candidates for purposes of contesting in an election is done during the days set for nomination by the respective returning officers that have been duly appointed by the commission,” said Mr Chebukati.

Even though Mr Waititu’s name appears among those who have expressed interests in the Nairobi governor seat, he is unlikely to be cleared since IEBC had already pronounced itself that leaders impeached on abuse of office charges are not eligible to run for elective posts.
Mr Chebukati said the commission is a creation of the law and as such shall uphold it.
“The commission is a creation of the law and it is not what an individual or an organisation says which guides what we do. We follow the law and when it comes to issues of candidates being referred to, we are guided by the law,” he said while launching the BBI signatures verification exercise at the Bomas of Kenya last Week.
“Similarly under Chapter 6, Article 75 and 180 of the constitution read together with Article 193 of the constitution, it is very clear that a person or an individual who has been impeached cannot run for an elective position,” said Mr Chebukati.
He pointed out that the law is also clear on individuals who have been convicted for a period of more than six months citing that they are not eligible to stand for an elective position.

IEBC had set February 18 for the by-election following the impeachment of former Governor Mike Sonko but the High Court on Monday suspended a gazette notice calling for the vote.

In his ruling, Justice Anthony Mrima temporarily stopped the mini poll on the basis of Mr Sonko’s petition challenging the process that led to his ouster late last year. Feeling cornered after being charged with the theft of Sh357 million, Governor Mike Sonko went on the rampage. He is seeking to stop the Nairobi by-election and the vetting of deputy governor nominee, Anne Kananu Mwenda. Majimbo Simiyu Kalasinga bagged the Ford Kenya party ticket by beating Nakuru East Sub-county Commissioner Erick Wanyonyi 75 to 30 votes. Senate Majority Chief Whip says he did not give the letter to any media outlet.
