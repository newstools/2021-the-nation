A Chuka court in Tharaka Nithi County Tuesday denied bond a woman accused of extracting four false teeth from a one-month-old baby boy using a razor blade, leading to his death.
The prosecution argued that, if released, the suspect, who hails from Magutuni in Maara Sub-county, was likely to interfere with the investigations.

The officer added that the woman, who is said to be a herbalist, also needed to be taken for mental assessment, and also that a post-mortem exam had to be conducted on the body to confirm the cause of death.
Ruling on the bond application, Chief Magistrate John Njoroge noted that the suspect is likely to face murder charges and that such charges needed thorough investigations.
“The woman will be brought back to court on January 22,” said Mr Njoroge.
The infant died while receiving treatment at Magutuni Sub-county hospital where he was taken with bleeding gums.

The boy’s mother, 21-year-old Kelly Nkatha from Tharaka North Sub-county, told the police that she had been informed by villagers that the suspect was experienced in removing the natal teeth that make babies uncomfortable.
