Dr Kasirivu, who was in his vehicle returning from a radio programme at Emambya FM in Kakumiro Town, faced gunfire where over eight bullets riddled through the vehicle.
He and his driver escaped unhurt after the driver sped off from the scene.
Dr Kasirivu told Daily Monitor that he survived because of God’s mercy. He suspects the attack is politically motivated ahead of tomorrow’s general elections.





“They almost finished our lives. As we were approaching my home at a swampy place, unknown people who were armed with guns opened fire on us. As gunfire raged, I told the driver to speed off and that is how we escaped unhurt. I don’t know who was behind this attack but I have informed the police. It was a miracle for me to survive,” he said.
The minister’s bodyguard, who was driving the vehicle, said the ambush was laid by about two gunmen who were firing from both sides.
The Kakumiro District Police Commander, Mr Twaha Buyinza confirmed that there was a shooting at the minister’s car adding that police investigations have commenced.
“I can confirm that there was a shooting at the minister’s car but we immediately dispatched police from Nyalweyo and more police officers are going to be dispatched to the scene of the crime to investigate the matter,” he said.
