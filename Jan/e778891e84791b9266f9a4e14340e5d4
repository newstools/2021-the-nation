Veteran Kanu politician Zablon Owigo Olang’ died on Sunday at a hospital in Nyatike, Migori County, sources within his family said.
The former Ndhiwa MP died a few minutes after midday at St Carmilla's Hospital in Karundu village.
A close relative, who requested anonymity as he is not authorised to speak on behalf of family, said Olang had been receiving treatment at the facility but did not give details.

The cause of death was not immediately clear but the family is expected to issue a statement.
Fondly referred to as ‘gogni,’ which loosely translates to ‘rocky hill’, Olang' was elected Ndhiwa MP under Kanu and served between 1979 and 1984.
This was before the constituency was divided to form Nyatike Constituency.
Migori Woman Representative Pamella Odhiambo and Nyatike legislator Tom Odege eulogised Olang’ as a true patriot who changed the political landscape.

“He was one of the veteran politicians who changed the face of democracy at a time when freedom of expression was curtailed under a single-party system,” Dr Odhiambo told the Nation on phone.
She added, “He went door to door looking for votes as campaigns had not become as sophisticated as they are today.”
Mr Odege described Olang’ as “one of the earliest politicians who made politics a reality by engaging in door to door campaigns while hunting for votes.” Mr Akumu also served as COTU secretary general. He died on Sunday morning at Mombasa Hospital. The former Nairobi governor also explains why he did not file an election petition.
