It is said he came home on December 29, 2020 for a family meeting before he drowned himself at the dam three days later.
Details about the incident remain scanty although his elder brother Aaron Sing’oei said the deceased arrived home with a camera which was later stolen after unknown people broke into his house the same day he arrived home.
“The deceased who has been working with DP Ruto’s security team came home on Tuesday because that day we had a family meeting. He had a camera which was stolen and he reported the matter to the police. It is unfortunate that he took his life," said Mr Sing’oei.

The DP’s director of communication Emmanuel Tallam confirmed to the Nation that the deceased was a prison warden who was under the press unit.
“The deceased was not in the DP's security team but was a prison officer working as a driver in our communication team,” said Mr Tallam.
Mr Too’s death comes barely a year after Sergeant Kipyegon Kenei, an officer attached to the Deputy President's office, who was believed to have been a key witness in the fake Sh39 billion arms deal, died mysteriously. Police are suspecting a murder-suicide. His wife was rushed to the Kenyatta National Hospital in serious condition. The footbridge was damaged by a trailer carrying an excavator earlier in December 2020. However they made us feel, the men and women in this list elicited different emotions in all of us.
