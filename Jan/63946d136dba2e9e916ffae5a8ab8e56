Alagic revealed that he was taken a back by the allegations, insisting he was innocent even though at the end of the first half, he was furious with the match officials over decisions he felt were biased against his team."When I heard about the allegations, my initial reaction was absolute shock. I did not have communications with the opposition, and I certainly didn’t say what I am alleged to have said. The fact that anyone has even suggested that these words could come from my mouth is hurtful, disrespectful, and a complete lie," he said. Nairobi City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic has strongly denied claims that he made racial remarks against a Vihiga United player in their 1-1 draw in a BetKing Premier League contest on December 23, 2020 at Utalii grounds.
The club management has also independently done its investigations with the help of the match report and has found no evidence to link the 43-year-old Bosnian tactician to any racial remarks.
