Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi has appealed to the National Treasury to release money to the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) accounts so that they can allocate bursaries to needy students who are now resuming schooling.
He said the fund, which was tasked with improvement of infrastructure in schools, cannot do so for lack of money.

Speaking at Igembe Boys' High School where over 12,000 needy students turned up to collect bursary forms, Mr Mwirigi said they would be sending students back with no money but cheques would be sent later to schools.
The Igembe South NG-CDF has been offering full scholarships to 177 students.
The MP said the number of students seeking bursaries has increased since most families relied on miraa, whose market had significantly shrunk following the ban in Somalia.





Covid-19 pandemic
Mr Mwirigi said the Covid-19 pandemic has caused misery to many families, driving them to poverty, thus the need for government intervention.
“We have not received even a single coin. Today, we have over 12,000 students seeking money. Everyone who filled the forms will get something and we will write cheques for the successful applicants when we get the money. We acted with urgency since it is easier to get the students when they are at home than in school,” he said.
Mr Mwirigi, however, expressed concern that the Sh40 million allocated to the kitty is not enough for the populous constituency and promised to lobby for more.
“When I go back to Parliament in February, I will seek an increase so that more people can benefit and get adequate amounts,” he said.
