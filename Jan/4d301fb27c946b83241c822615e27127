The DP has urged the opposition leaders not to abandon the government during difficult times.He has also asked all leaders to find the place and space where they can work together. Deputy President William Ruto has urged the opposition to help the government address challenges facing it in the spirit of the 'Handshake' and not to point an accusing finger at the State at its hour of need.
Dr Ruto, who was addressing a congregation at the Friends International Centre (Quakers Church), Ngong Road in Nairobi, during a requiem mass for Mama Hannah Atsianzale, mother of ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, said the country has serious challenges that need concerted efforts to address.

“It is true we are in a difficult position as a country. We have very serious challenges globally and as a nation," the Deputy President said.
“We have the coronavirus pandemic that has caused a serious economic meltdown and we also have a serious health challenge that has put pressure on our health infrastructure and human capital, hence unrest in that sector, hence the need to help address them,” Ruto went on.





He told Mr Mudavadi, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula and ODM leader Raila Odinga to use their access to President Uhuru Kenyatta and provide the needed help to confront the situation.
“This is not time to point fingers but to stand together as a nation to confront this situation together especially now that we are in this space of the 'Handshake' where all of us are talking and working together,” the DP said.
He went on: “Let us be friends and partners when the times are good and even when times are bad. It will not be fair for Musalia, Kalonzo, Weta and Agwambo to speak to the President as I do; it is only fair that we manage this situation together without saying it is you guys.”
He urged the opposition leaders not to abandon the government during difficult times.

“Let it not just be that when things are good we are in the Handshake but when they are bad you are not with us. This is not the time for us versus them. We need to pull together and deal with the situations that confront our nation,” said Dr Ruto.
Jubilee failures
He asked all leaders to find the place and space where they can work together.
“The challenges we face don’t wear ethnic regalia. They are national challenges that require national thinking, approach and a national team to address,” he said.
The DP spoke against the backdrop of Mr Odinga’s attack on him for blaming the Handshake for failures of the Jubilee government.
Mr Odinga said Dr Ruto is part of the making of the mess in the country and hence should take responsibility.
Speaking in Mombasa while meeting Muslim professionals and scholars on Sunday, the ODM leader said the BBI process will provide solutions to many national problems
“Raila hajaingia katika serikali… ako nje ya serikali… ile ambayo tumefanya mpaka leo ni kujaribu kutekeleza yale tulikubaliana na Uhuru,” said the former Prime Minister.
“Lakini yule ambaye amekuwa naibu wake kwa miaka nane anaanza kuruka… anasema yeye si responsible... analaumu mambo ya BBI… na anakula mshahara, ako na security… alafu anaanza kudhulumu hiyo serikali anasema Raila ndio ako responsible.”

But the DP on Thursday said it was not fair for leaders in the opposition to purport to be part of the government when things are rosy for them and only run away from it during challenges.
The requiem mass was attended by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, President Kenyatta’s brother Muhoho Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, who read the President’s condolence message, and a host of Senators and MPs. Opposition chief criticises Deputy President William Ruto for opposing the BBI. DP's allies say proposed referendum to change Constitution will flop nationally because it is unpopular. All funds will be channelled directly through implementing partners. Deliberations of the secret night meeting resulted in the explosive letter that has ignited the current raging fire.
