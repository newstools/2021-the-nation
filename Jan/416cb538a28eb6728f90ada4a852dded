"We all know that Wetang’ula hails from here in Kabuchai and there are some individuals who are out to demean him and frustrate him as the lion's party boss. We want Kabuchai electorate to show them that Weta is a real man by winning this by-election very early in the morning," he said.
On his part, Mr Wetang’ula said that Ford Kenya is a party that believes in democracy and that is why the nomination was conducted openly.
"We did not sit in a room somewhere and picked a candidate the way others are doing," he said.
The Bungoma senator said that he is aware of plans by some individuals who are being used by outside forces to try and sabotage the unity of Ford Kenya, adding that they will not succeed.
