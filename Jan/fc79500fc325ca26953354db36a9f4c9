Asia’s premier club competition has been expanded from 32 teams to 40 this year.
The Red Knights have been to every Champions League edition since 2012 with their best place finish being quarter-final stage in 2013, 2015 and 2018.
However, this will be the first time Kenyan international striker will be taking part in the Champions League outside of Africa. His previous clubs Djurgardens (Sweden), Guizhou Zhicheng Hengfeng (China), Girona (Spain) and Kashiwa Reysol (Japan) never qualified for Champions League during his time there. The 'Engineer' joined Al Duhail two weeks ago from Kashiwa.





Last season, Al Duhail bowed out at the group stage in a pool that had Persepolis (Iran), Al Tawoun (Saudi Arabia) and Sharjah (UAE).
Al Duhail and Al Ahli Saudi met in the 2012 edition with the Qatari winning 1-0 at their own turf before surrendering 3-0 away.  
Al Duhail know Esteghlal from the 2019 edition when they thrashed the Iranian side 3-0 in the first leg in Qatar before managing a 1-1 draw away.
All group stage matches will be played on a double round-robin basis in centralised venues due to the coronavirus pandemic. The winners of each group and three best runners-up from each region will advance to the round of 16 of the knockout stage.
