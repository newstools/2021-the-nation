This will be the second goodwill gesture by Purko community as the current land of more than 100 acres where the university sits on was also donated by the community. 
The Purko Development Trust, which is extensively engaged ingrowing barley, wheat, potatoes and peas as well as rearing cattle and merino sheep, was established 65 years ago and owns a total of 5,500 acres of land in Narok County.





Fruitful negotiations 
“We have held fruitful negotiations with Purko Development Trust and the good news is that we are close to acquiring the land. We are asking the community to donate to the university about 250 acres to set up the hospitality centre,” said Maasai Mara University acting Vice-Chancellor Kitche Magak.
Prof Magak added: “As we speak , established financial institutions are willing to support this project once we conclude the negotiations to acquire the land near Ole Tipis Girls High School in Narok town. We shall ensure we do due diligence with the Ministry of Lands, Treasury and Attorney General’s office before we sign the final documents.”
PDT chief executive Joseph Nkaiwuatei confirmed the deal was at an advanced stage but did not divulge details.
“We hope to conclude it with the relevant government authorities such as the Ministry of Lands,” said Mr Nkaiwuatei.

Prof Magak revealed that, due to financial constraints, the university is in the process of organising a funds drive to get the seed money to start the project.
