Karanga, a grandson of a Kiambu veteran professional Michael Karanga Mwaura, fired a 54-hole total of 226 gross to win the 62nd edition of the Sigona Bowl, which this time found a new sponsor in Turf Machinery and Irrigation, a company that is usual associated with golf course irrigation system.
Over the past two or so decades, the Sigona Bowl, usually the season opener in the KAGC series, formerly the Golfer of The Year series, had been sponsored by Kibo Sports.
Karanga, one of the amateurs who has also been participating in the Safari Tour pro series, said he intends to play a number of the KAGC events this year.





“I did not start well this weekend, but I managed to recover in the last two rounds and I am very happy to have won the event at the end," said Karanga, now At Sigona Golf Club.
He had started with seven over par 79, which left him five shots behind round one leader Jay Sandhu of Royal.
However, he shot one under par 71 in the second round and finished with two over par 74 for a total of 224, to beat former Kenya Amateur Match play champion Paul Muchangi of Limuru by two shots.
This victory earned Karanga a total of 84 points, while Muchangi, who posted 76, 73 and 77 for a total of 226, was awarded 48 points, and Nyali Golf and Country Club’s Adel Balala, who also carded 77 in the final round for the third place on 228 points, earned 32 points towards the KAGC points series.
