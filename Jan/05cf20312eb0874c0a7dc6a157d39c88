Police in Nyamira are holding a Form Two student for allegedly attacking his teacher with a panga.
The student at Mokwerero Secondary School attacked the deputy principal of the school on Wednesday after he was allegedly denied to change his old exercise books for new ones. 
The incident happened a day after a Form Three student at Kisii High School attacked and injured two teachers using a kitchen knife after he was asked to kneel.

Manga Sub-County Police Commander Gabriel Mwangangi said the deputy head teacher escaped unhurt.
The police boss said the suspect was spotted sharpening a panga by his neighbours on Tuesday, but his motive was not known.
“The suspect will be arraigned for the law to take its own course” Mr Mwangangi said.
On Tuesday, the 17-year-old student at Kisii High School was arraigned and charged with attempted murder.
