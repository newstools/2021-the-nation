Thirty out of 39 members of the Nyandarua County Assembly voted Friday to impeach Speaker Wahome Ndegwa on charges including abuse of office.
The lawmakers hurriedly convened a special sitting after a court ruling cleared the impeachment motion sponsored by majority leader Kingori Wambugu.
The Speaker had moved to court to seek orders barring the assembly from impeaching him, arguing MCAs did not follow the right procedure.

But Nakuru High Court Judge Isaac Ngugi allowed the process to continue, provided the law and procedure were followed.
After the ruling, a Gazette notice calling the special sitting was published, paving the way for the tabling of the motion and the debate.
One MCA voted against the motion while eight were absent.
Addressing the Media outside the assembly following the vote, Mr Wambugu said the House followed the right procedure as they had a Gazette notice allowing a special sitting, He said the notice obtained by Deputy Speaker Zackary Njeru.

The accusations
Mr Ndegwa is accused of corruption and unethical practices through nepotism by employing at least 10 members of his immediate family.
He is also accused of appointing Ms Nancy Njoki Muriithi, who works with Mr Wahome Ndegwa & Company Advocates, to the County Public Service Board without declaring interest.
He is also accused of influencing tendering for the hiring of his personal vehicle by the assembly at an inflated cost of Sh12,000 in a day, against a standard charge of Sh3,000 in a day.
Mr Ndegwa is further accused of illegally paying himself Sh606,000 in allowances and appointing himself a signatory to bank accounts from which colossal amounts of money were irregularly withdrawn.

On the stalled Sh500 million office complex, the MCAs claim Mr Ndegwa received kickbacks.
They also want to know why the Speaker is demanding Sh100 million for completion of the complex whose value was Sh400 million.
Mr Ndegwa has denied the charges. He said Friday that he will sue for contempt of court and insisted that the law and procedures have been abused. The case will now be heard by Nakuru High Court Presiding Judge Joel Ngugi on December 23. Governor condemns clerk for denying MCAs access to their offices. Politicians led by Johnson Muthama, Susan Kihika and Kipchumba Murkomen say they have found peace and equality. The investigations have been narrowed down to close family members as well as the extended family. Employment Court quashed the appointment of Ms Wambui as the chairperson of the National Employment Authority.
