A rally by ODM leader Raila Odinga was on Wednesday afternoon disrupted by stone pelting youths in Githurai. 
The youths, who were chanting pro-Deputy President William Ruto slogans, threw stones on vehicles including Mr Odinga's chase cars. 
The windscreen of a vehicle belonging to Nation Media Group was destroyed during the fracas.
