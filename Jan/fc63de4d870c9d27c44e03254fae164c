“It’s a great feeling and I am happy to win this nice race despite all the inactivity challenges brought by Covid-19,” said Bii, who is based in Eldoret.
“It was tough to convince my guide Robert Tarus to leave his family in Kericho to come and train with me and it’s quite a humbling gesture that he accepted,” explained Bii, who is now focused on making his third Olympic Games come Tokyo Summer Games, having attained the “A” qualifying time.





The Dubai Athletics Para Grand Prix due February 7-14 is one of the Tokyo Paralympic Games qualifying events that the National Paralympic Committee of Kenya (KNPC) have lined up for Kenyan athletes.

“Basically to 12 goes to the Paralympics but I want to be sure with a throw of 30m plus."
