Police in Kirinyaga County are holding a former police officer accused of cohabiting with a Form One student.
The man was seized when police raided his hideout at Kagio town on Saturday.
According to the Kirinyaga East Sub-County police boss Anthony Wanjuu, the suspect was seized after the schoolgirl's mother reported the matter to police.

Mr Wanjuu said the girl was at home during the long closure of schools due to Covid-19 when the ex-police officer lured and married her.
When the schools reopened on Monday, the Form One girl who hails from Gathoge village with her lover did not report and her mother alerted the police.
On learning that he was being sought for questioning, the suspect took off and went underground.
"The suspect has been living with the minor in his house for more than two weeks and this is a very serious matter," Mr Wanjuu said.

He said detectives managed to apprehend the suspect and locked him up at Kianyaga police station because the mother was very cooperative.
Mr Wanjuu said the suspect will face defilement charges once detectives are through with investigations.
"We shall not spare anyone found spoiling young girls who are in school. Children should be allowed to learn and complete their education without interference," he said. The accused claims he was framed after he differed with the complainant's brother. The 51-year-old admitted that he had sex with his daughters, believed to be 14 and 16 years old. The man who holds a Nigerian passport was on Friday night arrested in connection with a gruesome killing in Syokimau. Stephen Thuku was reportedly blocked by another car at Nairobi’s Githurai Mwihoko area by three armed men. Politicians express their views on matters including the 2022 poll and Mudavadi's position as Mama Hannah is buried.
