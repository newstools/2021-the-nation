However because of Covid-19 pandemic, the Nandi and Nyali legs had to be cancelled until this year. The 2020 Machakos leg was held on January 4, where home player James Ndunda then playing off handicap six carded 37 points in an event played on a tough course then, to become the 2020 King of The Course.
