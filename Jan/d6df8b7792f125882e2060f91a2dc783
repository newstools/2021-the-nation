South Sudan will switch to a new time zone on February 1, a government official has said.
The country will move back one hour from Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) +3 to UTC+2,  labour undersecretary Mary Hillary Wani Pitia said in a written announcement to civil service institutions, commissions, diplomatic missions, UN agencies, NGOs, international organisations and the public.

}



She said the new time zone is based on South Sudan’s location on the globe.
Two weeks ago, South Sudan’s Cabinet approved switching to a new time zone.
Many South Sudanese criticised the new decision on social media.
Once the change becomes effective, South Sudan will be in a similar time zone with countries including Egypt, Sudan and Malawi.   
The government spokesperson, Michael Makuei Lueth, said the country has not been using its real time. Juba says it wants to intensify online and embassy visa applications to raise revenues. Those in need include 310,000 refugees and asylum seekers. They are the new chair and vice chair succeeding Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), respectively. Jubilee party official says BBI was sold in Mount Kenya by force “and Murang'a Senator did nothing bad to highlight these issues to the President.”
