A showdown is looming at the Nyandarua County Assembly as ousted Speaker Wahome Ndegwa insists he is still in charge.
Mr Wahome was impeached last week after the Nakuru High Court gave clearance for an impeachment motion on condition that procedure is followed.
He has sought the support of the County Assemblies Forum, where he is the chairman, and is also moving to court to challenge the ouster.

He insists that the law was not followed and accuses national government officials and the Interior ministry of meddling in the assembly’s affairs.
Mr Wahome says it was wrong for police to guard the assembly during the special sitting that he claims was unconstitutionally convened to impeach him.
However, Majority Leader King’ori Wambugu says the troubled Speaker will not be allowed to conduct any business.

“He will not and cannot conduct any House business; the majority has spoken. He won’t use the House to advanced his political agenda in the next general elections where he has declared interest in the governor’s position,” said Shamata MCA Gitau Njamba. Thirty out of 39 MCAs voted for his impeachment at a special sitting that followed a court ruling allowing the process. Justice Joel Ngugi says the process did not follow statutory procedures. Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor gives his report on the nature of injuries suffered following post-mortem exams. His presidential campaign team says he will conduct radio and TV interviews to persuade voters to turn up in big numbers. Ugandan government officials are accused of seeking to manipulate public debate ahead of the elections.
