Police boss says perpetrators of such acts will be dealt with firmly. The IG says efforts to bring back order on the roads has resulted in fewer casualties this year. Kenyans have been warned against provoking the police and posting their reactions on social media.
In his New Year message, Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai on Thursday said such acts could land them into trouble as the police are mandated to perform their duties firmly.
“We have in the recent past experienced cases of attacks on police officers on duty by members of the public who are either challenging the rule of law or simply expressing self-conceited acts of arrogance. Their modus operandi is to upload videos on social media to ridicule the NPS and subject innocent officers to the unforgiving court of public opinion,” he said.

The IG’s remarks follows an incident that happened in Nakuru County last month where three police officers were recorded on camera attacking a motorist and a journalist on the Nakuru-Nairobi highway.





The viral clip caused an uproar with commentators accusing the police leadership of spinning the truth to hide the sins of junior officers. However, in his response, the IG said the motorist was stopped while overlapping contrary to his claims that one of the officers at the scene had hit his car.
“Members of the public who witnessed the incident volunteered to record statements. The video circulating has not shown the full incident as it occurred. The IG has warned members of the public against assaulting police officers in uniform and on duty,” Mr Mutyambai responded in a tweet.
Attempted terror attacks
Mutyambai urged all officers to execute their duties firmly and without any fear but within the law limits even as Kenyans usher in the new year amid the Covid-19 health regulations.
For the first time in history, revellers did not watch fireworks displays in their usual entertainment joints when the clock ticked midnight due to the ongoing 10pm curfew.

The pandemic has claimed the lives of a number of police officers while on duty dealing a blow to the service that has also bore the brunt of having their leave days cancelled in order to boost security and enforce health rules.
“I am happy to note that our officers adapted quickly to the new challenges and have been able to accomplish the tasks with great success,” Mr Mutyambai noted in the message.
Amongst the successes alluded to include thwarting a number of attempted terror attacks due to increased surveillance and prompt response by the security agencies.
The IG also noted that, though road carnage remains a major cause of deaths across the country, efforts to bring back order on the roads has resulted in fewer casualties this year. Three police officers are seen attacking a motorist who confronted one of them for hitting his car. Angela Muiruri was among 21 women who were attacked during a security operation in Nairobi’s Kileleshwa estate. The new year has a rude welcome in the end of the Covid-19 tax reliefs. Without fees during the nine-month closure, many private schools were unable to pay staff, teachers and other workers.
