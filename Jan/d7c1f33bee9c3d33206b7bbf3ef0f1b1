They are competing to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta whose 10-year term is coming to an end.
Dr Kituyi was a powerful minister during President Mwai Kibaki’s regime. His term at Unctad will end mid this year.
Dr Kitui was appointed the seventh Unctad secretary-general on September 1, 2013 and reappointed for another four-year term in July 2017, the term beginning on September 1 that year.
Ready to serve





Dr Kituyi said he is ready to contest against the political bigwigs and that he can ably serve Kenyans owing to his international experience.
As stated on the Unctad website, he studied political science and international relations at the University of Nairobi and at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
Dr Kituyi said his presidency will address Kenyans’ vulnerabilities and key problems, and ensure the economy improves.
Addressing the press in Bungoma town, he said, “It is no longer a secret. I will be going for the presidency in 2022. Nobody should tell us who to support. We need a President who will save this country and Kenyans from a bad economy.”
Dr Kituyi noted that nobody was born a leader as it is something one has to fight for.
He has already started touring the country for meetings with key people as he plans to form a team to work on his bid.
