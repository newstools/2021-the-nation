Were said Odera has been one of the paramount forces behind the steady rise of Wazalendo club and it will only be fair for the club to stand with him at his time of need."Wazalendo has been assisting to supplement his upkeep in the village. And now that he is going for the second surgery, we are trying in our own little ways, but we are also reaching out to the whole nation to help us have a successful initiative. As a club, we still need Odera's services and we hope to raise the amount so that the surgery can be conducted for Odera to resume his normal life," said the official.

When contacted on Sunday, Odera, 59, whose speech is also slur, hopes people will hear his cry and come to his aid.
His wife, Cindy Morphine, said life has never been the same since her husband's first operation in 2004.
Odera underwent an Epileptic surgery at Kenyatta Hospital in 2004.
"Wazalendo club has been taking care of us since then and the Railways pension income has not been reliable. The situation forced us to move to Kisumu in 2009.Â  I'm aware my husband (Odera) played for Kenya won a couple of events. I hope that with those memories, well wishers and people of good will help us raise the amount," said Morphine.
