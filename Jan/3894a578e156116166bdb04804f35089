Muoki Nzavi had fled after allegedly stabbing his mother Esther Nzilani, 78, to death and injuring the sister Irene Nzilani, 36, in the dawn attack.
The man depended on his late mother for upkeep and has a history of violence.
A distress call by a 13-year-old daughter of the younger woman attracted neighbours.
They found the body of the family matriarch lying lifeless in a pool of blood in her sitting room as her daughter, who was disembowelled and bleeding profusely, fought for her life outside.

Ramshackle kitchen
She narrated to their immediate neighbour David Munyao how her brother had stabbed them.
She died while being treated at the Kibwezi Sub-county Hospital, leaving her daughter, who is in Standard Four, orphaned. 
At the scene of the crime, the police collected a damaged kitchen knife believed to have been used by the man to stab the two women.
Irate locals mounted a spirited search for the fugitive in the area bordering Chyullu Hills National Park.
Grief-stricken neighbours told of a man who kept to himself and loved chewing khat.
But he slept on pieces of sacks in his mother’s ramshackle kitchen.
A neighbor, who identified as a confidant of the slain matriarch, said the family knew no peace as Muoki had a habit of quarrelling the mother.

Until her death, she served as the treasurer of a merry-go-round that draws membership from local women.
“He threatened to beat her up especially when she failed to give him money,” Ms Priscilla Mutune added.
Muoki attracted the wrath of neighbours a year ago after he had threatened to kill his mother.
Neighbours responded to her distress call, rounded him up and beat him before handing him over to the police.
“He was charged and set free three months later after the mother and the sister failed to appear in court to testify,” Mr Mwonga told the Nation.
