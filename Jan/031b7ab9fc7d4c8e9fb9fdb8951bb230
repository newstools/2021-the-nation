Police in Kisii have detained a student, 17, who reportedly attacked his teachers with a knife at Kisii High School on Tuesday, leaving them with serious injuries.
“He was told to go and kneel down at the staffroom after he came to class late. Instead he took the weapon, causing teachers and students to flee for their safety,” said Kisii County Commissioner Abdirizak Jaldesa about the Form Three student.

Learning at the school came to a standstill as education and county officials held a crisis meeting to quell tension following the 9am attack this morning.
The administrator said the assailant managed to reach the teacher who gave him the punishment, injuring him on the head.
One teacher, Edwin Nyakundi, sustained injuries to his left shoulder, abdomen, head and left leg, according to the police report. He was rushed to RAM Hospital and admitted in stable condition.





A second teacher who came to his colleague’s recue, Mr Elvis Maoto, sustained stab wounds on his cheeks. He was treated and discharged from RAM Hospital. 
“(He) looked disturbed. When we questioned him, he told us he did not want to learn in a boarding school,” said Mr Jaldesa.
Omari Otungu, executive secretary of the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers in Kisii, condemned the reported attack and called on the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to advocate for teachers’ rights.
He said teachers were constantly living in fear of being beaten by students since there were no disciplinary mechanisms.
“We want to be protected the same way the government is protecting students,” said Mr Otungu.
He asked parents to discipline their children and not to take sides when they are reprimanded for unruly behaviour in schools.
