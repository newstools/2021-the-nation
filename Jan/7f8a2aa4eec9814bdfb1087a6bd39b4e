Nation.Africa was launched a few months ago with a mobile-first mindset and with the versatile African youth in focus. Our legacy brand, The Daily Nation, our flagship, established itself as a champion of the emergent independence movement.
The new Nation brand now gives us a vehicle to take us to all parts of the continent, to reach and inspire African youth on a platform that has become the most important part of their lives: the mobile phone. Our outlook on Africa is not from a racial definition but from a community perspective.
Any person who has made Africa their home is an African. Africa is diverse; its racial, ethnic and class composition is as complex as its history which goes right back to the origins of our race. But our identity is strong and transcends those distinctions.
Our commitment is to be there for every African, to empower them and carry, project and protect their aspirations. Indeed, we are Africa’s largest independent media brand. Our aspiration is to empower by informing, educating and engaging our diverse audience. We have provided the highest quality stories, video, podcasts through Nation Audio and Nation Puzzles.
