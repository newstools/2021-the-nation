Pressure to have the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) cut business links with French technology firm Idemia Identity and Securities Limited has intensified just days after it emerged that the commission was pushing to have the firm’s contract renewed ahead of the 2022 General Election.

The company was in 2016 awarded a five-year contract to maintain IEBC’s Kenya Integrated Election Management System (Kiems) that hosts the register of voters.
The contract is set to end this month with the commission now pushing to have it renewed.
But Wednesday, Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma told the Nation that he has petitioned the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) of the National Assembly to summon IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati to explain why the commission cannot contract any other firm for the job.





“Idemia’s continued engagement with the IEBC in providing technology used in the elections will be a tragedy that we do not want to witness as a country in the coming days,” Mr Kaluma said.
The French firm was controversially awarded Sh6.8 billion to supply the Kiems kits used in the August 8, 2017 General Election.
Kits failed
However, the kits failed on election day and this was one of the reasons that the Supreme Court relied on to nullify the presidential election. 
This was the first time a presidential election had been nullified in Africa, and only the third time it was happening across the world, with grave social and financial consequences to Kenya.
But despite the nullification, the company is yet to comply with the orders issued by the Supreme Court requiring it to open its servers used in the 2017 presidential election for scrutiny.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



“Idemia should not be contracted by IEBC to provide technology for elections in Kenya until it guarantees and it is confirmed by IEBC that the company has addressed the failures in its systems which led to the nullification of the 2017 presidential election,” said the Homabay Town MP.
But even as the MPs spoke, Idemia is already on the verge of being awarded a Sh10 billion tender for the supply of a technology to be used in the referendum for the planned constitutional amendment this year and the 2022 General Election.
Huduma Namba kits
Other than the election related contracts, the company was also hired in 2019 by the government to supply 31,500 biometric kits for the registration of Huduma Namba.
Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi, an IT expert, said that election management in any country must be of the highest credibility and that Idemia is not ready to do that.
“It is not right for the IEBC to continue insisting on Idemia. The issues that informed the company’s debarment in the country are bare for all to see,” Mr Osotsi said.
Perhaps what could be the source of confusion and suspicion is the continued name change and rebranding by the company in the recent past.

});
}, 62000);
}



Changed names
The company has changed names thrice during the period it has had lucrative deals in the country.

});
}, 62000);
}



In 2013, the firm supplied the multi-billion shillings biometric voter registration (BVR) kits under Safran Morpho before changing to OT-Morpho during the 2017 elections.
In April 2019, the National Assembly adopted the amended report of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to block the French technology firm from doing business in the country for at least 10 years, citing a violation of the Companies Act.
In its findings, the watchdog committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi found the firm to have operated in the country illegally as it was not registered before doing business in Kenya, contrary to the companies’ law.
However, the firm successfully appealed against the resolution of the National Assembly at the High Court.
The High Court directed that the offensive recommendations against the firm be expunged from the report adopted by the House.
But the National Assembly has since appealed against the court judgment.
“For now I cannot say anything because the matter is in court. But as a committee we are in constant consultation with the lawyers representing the National Assembly in the appeal as we await the outcome,” Mr Wandayi said.
Local representatives
The Companies Act provides that before an entity does business in the country, it must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Idemia, being a foreign company, was required to have its local representatives duly registered in the country.

googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-4");
});
}



Efforts to have the company’s local representative appear before PAC failed as none appeared.
“Idemia should not engage in business in Kenya until it registers its local representatives with the Registrar of Companies as is obligated by the Companies Act and as resolved by Parliament,” said Mr Kaluma.
“This legal provision has been in our laws since the Companies Act, 1948, to secure corporate accountability and is not new in our laws as wrongly suggested by the High Court,” the legislator said.
