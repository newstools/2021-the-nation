Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has defended Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata, who has been heavily criticised over his views on the support of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) in central Kenya.
BBI supporters have criticised the Murang'a senator for his letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta in which he claimed that the BBI was unpopular in Central Kenya and predicted its defeat.

Mr Kang'ata's remarks angered mainly the supporters of President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga.
They accuse the Murang'a senator of playing into the hands of critics of the constitutional amendment drive through the BBI.
Governor Mutua, who is among those supporting the BBI, stopped short of praising the senator for highlighting apparent woes bedevilling President Kenyatta's management of politics.
He said Mr Kang'ata had rescued the BBI.





"What the courageous Senate Majority Chief Whip has done is to vocalise the whispers that have been going on due to propaganda by opposers of the BBI,” he said.
"By speaking about the challenges as he sees them, he has issued a call to arms, which has now made the BBI issue and its success, especially in Mt. Kenya region, an issue of debate and hopefully, action.” Ten governors under Cereb have joined the onslaught against him over the BBI's popularity in Mt Kenya. Nyeri Town MP Mr Ngunjiri Wambugu said Mr Kang’ata was not sincere in his letter for sharing it with the media and the public. Senior specialists among those affected.

Keen to expand his support base, Dr Ruto, backed by his allies, has gone full-blown to challenge his main political opponents.
