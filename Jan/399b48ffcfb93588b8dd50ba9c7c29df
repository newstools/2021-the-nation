The London-born midfielder¬†has not featured for Harambee Stars, but was in the team named for 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match against Sierra Leone in November 2018. The match did not go ahead as the West African country was banned by FIifa¬†over government interference. His first stop abroad was in Greece donning the Acharnaikos colours. Gor Mahia looked to be the real deal this season after signing 14 top players. The pardon came after his meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, who is on an official tour of Tanzania. The cases failed to kick off to allow prime suspect Lawrence Njoroge Warunge to undergo a mental exam. The country has raised security concerns after Somalia‚Äôs federal and regional forces renewed fighting at Bula Hawa in the Gedo region.
