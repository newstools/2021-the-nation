It has been the tradition for Presidents to spend the New Year at State House, Mombasa while addressing the nation, but he welcomed his new neighbours to what close sources say might be his retirement home in Oloolmongi, Lolgorian Ward.
The Head of State issued his New Year address to the Nation at the 1,000-acre-plus ranch with the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve on the background.
He bought the ranch last year from Olerien and Kengani group ranches. He also purchased another piece of land where he is building a tourist lodge.





Sources who attended the function said they were ordered to leave their mobile phones behind with the security at the gate as photography was strictly prohibited.
Goodies
Before ushering New Year, the Head of State had attended a private function attended by Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, MCAs Kuyo ole Kijabe (Kimintet) and Michael Seme (Lolgorian).
During the private meeting, sources say, the President promised locals of goodies, among them, that the government would employ an assistant county commissioner from the region.
Mr Kenyatta also promised job opportunities for the youth, as well as the establishment of a primary school and connection of electricity.
Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina on his Twitter handle thanked the President for choosing to stay in Narok County over the holidays.
