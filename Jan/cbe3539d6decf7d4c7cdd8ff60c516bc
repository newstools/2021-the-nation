Kang’ata only fell short of asking politicians to draft bills in Parliament to address coffee, tea, avocado, bananas, milk and horticultural products.Murang’a people have previously supported political initiatives but never fully benefited from them. The open letter by Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata has catapulted him into a hero for daring the route Kenneth Matiba took in 1990. However, our era is interesting in that political priorities do not rhyme with economic realities.
Murang’a residents feel deprived and neglected by the current crop of politicians who only seek selfish interests and election survival. Nobody is bothered about these facts since most politicians are so intoxicated in the BBI wine.

For instance, the major natural resource in the area has been channelled to Nairobi by construction of Ndakaini Dam three decades ago. Instead of allowing residents to use the remaining water, another project code named Northern Water Collector Tunnel harvests water from streams and rivers and delivers it by pipe to Nairobi.
The dual carriageway from Kenol was mooted to pass through Murang’a town and would have brought economic tidings to Kaharati and Maragua, but was diverted. Coffee, tea and avocados attracts meagre prices while the cost of production is very high due to lack of subsidies.





Unemployment rates
In his letter, Senator Kang’ata reiterated that “jeshi ti ngenu” due to marginalisation that began during the Moi era. Unemployment is rife while young men are labelled as members of a sect. The Majority Leader in Parliament Amos Kimunya insinuated that the senator only spoke to people whose pre-occupation is to hang around in shopping centres (Mung’etho).
Murang’a is a shell of its former self with vibrant towns growing cold and dangerous. Once-prosperous towns, such as Maragua, Kiriani, Kirwara, Kangema, Kahuro, Gatura, Kangari, Kandara, Muthithi and Kaharati, are almost dead.
Kang’ata only fell short of asking politicians to draft bills in Parliament to address coffee, tea, avocado, bananas, milk and horticultural products. The Sh15 billion stimulus package for fish farming excluded Murang’a to cover only Embu, Kirirnyaga and Nyeri, yet it has more water.

Elite politicians
Surprisingly, no leader from Murang’a petitioned to include the county in the program but they are enthused about the BBI. We need a push-pull economic agenda that will bring an avocado factory in Kahuro, a medical college at Kirwara hospital and nationalise Gatanga and Michuki polytechnics.
Murang’a people have previously supported political initiatives but never fully benefited from them. Heroes like Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia and Mukaru Ng’ang’a paid the ultimate price for speaking out their voice. Honourable Kang’ata should not be cowed.
Elite politicians are at the eating table and are blind to peasants’ cry, unemployment and lack of purchasing power. The king should be jerked into action when the small boy from Murang’a speaks the naked truth.

Talk that the presidency is not the preserve of two communities risks dividing the country along tribal lines, he says. Independent candidates invited for a meeting in Nairobi later said they had been duped.
