Deputy President William Ruto has expressed optimism that he will lead the next government. 

Speaking in Msambweni, Kwale County on Thursday, the DP said the hustler movement will take over the Coast region, noting that the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader is the “first born” of the movement. 

“Are we together? Are we going to walk together? Have you allowed me to walk together with (Kwale Governor Salim) Mr Mvurya, (Turkana Governor Josphat) Mr Nanok and all the other hustlers to form the next government in 2022 ?” Dr Ruto asked residents amid cheers from supporters, who answered in the affirmative.

Mr Ruto, who led Tangatanga politicians supporting his 2022 candidature, said his train had already left the station and was unstoppable.  

He asked Kenyans not to bow to pressure and threats from popular parties, but to remain firm and vote for visionary leaders who have the potential to transform their lives. 






“The people of Msambweni refused to bow to pressure and threats, but instead went ahead to vote for the influential Mr Bader. He has no known political background, but he managed to beat the ODM candidate. This is a new record that shows that regardless of where one comes from, he/ she can ascend to a leadership position,” said the DP.  

Dr Ruto also criticised opposition leader Raila Odinga, saying Kenya will only be built through visionary leadership but not through politics of hatred and tribalism. 

During the homecoming party for Mr Bader, the Tangatanga team welcomed Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Nominated Senator Issack Mwaura , who said they had defected from Jubilee Party to Mr Ruto’s team. 

Hustler nation 

Mr Sonko criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta and accused him of abandoning and frustrating his close allies, who campaigned for him in 2013 and 2017.  

The Tangatanga politicians who attended the function said the wave of the hustler nation movement has taken off in Kwale and urged Kenyans to join the team “so that they can benefit from DP Ruto’s leadership when he ascends to power in 2022”.

Former Majority Leader in the National Assembly Aden Duale said he was still a member of Jubilee and has not planned to exit any time soon. He said he has shares in the party and thus cannot leave just like that. 

“Leaving the party will take long because it will need legal guidance. DP Ruto is the largest shareholder in Jubilee as the deputy party leader after Mr Kenyatta,” said Mr Duale. 

The politicians dismissed BBI , saying its proponents are people who are already in leadership positions. They urged Kenyans to reject the initiative. 

Coast politicians who attended the function called for the formation of a regional political party, which they will use to bargain at the national level.  

Dr Ruto also promised that the government will complete the projects it had started at the Coast region despite the financial constraints facing the country. 

The DP said the government is committed to improving the living standards of locals by ensuring that mega projects, including Mwache dam, will be completed to address the issue of water shortage both in Kwale and Mombasa.

} He paraded the newly elected Msambweni MP Feisal Bader as the “firstborn” of the so called Hustler's Movement. This is the clearest indication yet that they are fed up with the ruling Jubilee Party after months of simmering tensions. The new year has a rude welcome in the end of the Covid-19 tax reliefs. Without fees during the nine-month closure, many private schools were unable to pay staff, teachers and other workers. Senator speaks about a meeting that saved Nairobi, his governorship candidature and more.
