Former Nairobi County Education Executive Janet Ouko has made a comeback after acting Governor Benson Mutura made changes to his Cabinet.
Ms Ouko, who resigned from the county government in January 2019, has been reappointed to her former docket.
She will replace Ms Lucia Mulwa, who took over the Education, Youth Affairs and Sports docket following her (Ms Ouko’s) resignation.

Ms Mulwa has been reassigned to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock department which has been vacant since the sacking of the former holder of the position Winfred Kathangu last year.
“In line with the powers bestowed upon me by the Constitution and the County Governments Act, 2012, and in order to support the efficient exercise of county functions, I have today made the following appointments and realignments for effective service delivery,” said Mr Mutura on Wednesday when he announced the new changes.





“I will be communicating more changes in due course,” he added.
Replaced Sonko
Mr Mutura took over the leadership of the county government in December 2020 following the impeachment of former governor Mike Sonko.
The new changes have also seen super “Chief Officer” Jairus Musumba appointed as the acting county secretary, replacing Mr Justus Kathenge who has been in the position since June last year when Mr Leboo Morintat left.
Mr Musumba is the devolution chief officer but has also been holding forte in the Education department as acting chief officer.
The changes leave the Trade docket still without a substantive holder with a number of chief officer positions also vacant.
Lands CEC Charles Kerich, Health Services CEC Hitan Majevdia, Transport and Roads counterpart Mohammed Dagane, ICT and e-government Executive Newton Munene, Devolution CEC Vesca Kangogo, Finance Executive Allan Igambi and Environment CEC Larry Wambua are the other Cabinet members at City Hall.

The reorganization has also roped in human rights activist and lawyer Brain Weke who has joined the city county government as the legal advisor in the office of the governor while former councillor Paul Mutungi replaces Brian Mugo as the chief of staff.
