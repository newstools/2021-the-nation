Parliament has the right to make laws but not to stand by a breach of the law.It should be much more reactive to breaches than any other institution in order to give credence to the laws it enacts. The law is an ass, so the saying goes. Its origin is found in Oliver Twist, the novel by Charles Dickens. Mr Bumble, when wrongly accused of being complicit in theft by his wife, he uttered the following words: “The law is a ass — a idiot. If that’s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience — by experience.”

In layman’s terms, any law that does not engender justice or is open to abuse is largely considered being an ass — a donkey in archaic English — and hence the need for review.
The same phrase applies in Kenya in two ways. The first is to the category of ordinary people imprisoned on trumped-up charges. The second group of people it applies to is criminal politicians.
Hence, the clearance of Ferdinand Waititu by the Registrar of Political Parties to vie in the by-election of Nairobi governorship was misinformed and an illegality. This is a man who had been impeached as a governor in Kiambu County for abuse of office and faces criminal charges in a court of law. He is now attempting to lead the capital city, to be precise.

Prima facie evidence suggests he is a man of impaired credibility for having been found by Parliament — no less — as not fit to lead! In this case, any organisation that deals with him or other leaders with integrity issues (particularly government institutions), need to apply common sense.
It should not be the work of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alone but individual Kenyans, the Registrar of Political Parties included, and all other entities to disbar such individuals.

A situation that mirrors Waititu’s is that of John Waluke. Here is an MP for Sirisia who is confirmed a convict by a court of law. Which means Parliament should have declared his seat vacant and called for a by-election from the moment his sentence for 67 years was passed.
But it has, instead, allowed for him to continue drawing a salary as an MP despite being found guilty of corruption in the NCPB maize scandal. 
His appeal is completely irrelevant at this juncture. As things stand, he has lost the mandate of being an MP. Breach of Chapter Six of the Constitution, on integrity, is sufficient to trigger a recall of an MP.
Parliament has the right to make laws but not to stand by a breach of the law. It should be much more reactive to breaches than any other institution in order to give credence to the laws it enacts but alas! 
Clutches of cartels
Without institutions like Parliament being at the forefront of determining the law for what it is and not what it ought to be to criminal leaders, we shall never rescue this country from the clutches of cartels. Why did Parliament bother to enact Chapter Six of the Constitution if it does not believe in its spirit?
Determination of culpability and integrity is a matter of common sense as it is a matter of law. Avoidance of common sense in administration of justice has seen those in positions of authority get away with murder — literally.

Despite the courts’ decision that leaders charged with corruption and other heinous crimes step aside to facilitate investigations, some political parties are yet to ask them to do so. 





I wonder why the governor of Migori, Okoth Obado, who, with most of his family face serious criminal charges, continues to be considered a leader? His Samburu colleague Moses Lenolkulal is carrying on as normal as he battles corruption charges in court.
Parliament and IEBC have gone against the decision of both EACC and DCI on vetting and caused appointment and election of individuals who later turned out not fit to lead.
The likes of Waititu and his fellow impeached governor, Mike Sonko of Nairobi, should never have led any institution had IEBC and Parliament followed initial concerns raised on both individuals’ suitability to lead. 
Parliament, and political parties, are not exempt from Chapter Six of the Constitution. They are refusing to destroy impunity for no other reason but subterfuge.
Kenya legitimises leaders’ criminality like no other society does. Warped laws that our political class stand by and are acquiesced to by some rogue lawyers are perpetuating impunity. A man with blood on his hands is allowed to roam freely because the law is an ass, indeed a fallacy that only a rotten society can condone.

Somebody who plotted to steal billions of shillings from the public and abuse his office is both legally and politically punished. Which leaves his character in ruins. Such an individual has lost credibility and the right to represent honourable citizens. 
The suggestion, on made-up technicalities in law, by some lawyers that leaders charged with corruption, murder or rape should not step aside makes corruption and other crimes worse. Just like pregnancy and madness, integrity deficiency can be discerned by reasonable men and women. It is not a preserve of lawyers. 
The law may be an ass but is not completely devoid of common sense when it comes to integrity.
Ms Guyo is a legal researcher. kdiguyo@gmail.com. @kdiguyo Lately, funerals have become a platform for politicians. Stone-throwing has become synonymous with ODM party. IEBC is tomorrow (Monday) expected to gazette a list of party and independent aspirants for the seat. The man was freed last year after the mother and the sister failed to appear in court to testify in an assault case. In most schools, lack of classrooms, desks, water, toilets, and dormitories is a stark reality.
