The public has very little regard for an entity that embodies brutality and corruption.Yet, amid all the vile attributes associated with the police, still, it is a necessary evil. Recently, a senior police officer directed the public to change its negative attitudes towards law enforcers. Such attitudes are hurting the standing of the police, the honcho reckoned.
True. Attitudes are powerful. They direct behaviour. Attitudes determine success or failure of enterprises. That is why when a significant stakeholder develops a negative attitude towards your enterprise, you are alarmed.

Indeed, if the Police Service were a commercial enterprise, it would have closed shop eons ago. This is because the public has very little regard for an entity that embodies brutality and corruption.
Yet, amid all the vile attributes associated with the police, still, it is a necessary evil. The police system is a critical cog in the architecture of justice, more so in liberal democracies like Kenya.

In the Hobbesian conception, it’s anarchy that occasioned humanity to surrender certain sovereignties to a body called the state. The police, therefore, is central to statecraft — to tame our wild impulses for anarchy.
And thus, to paraphrase Thomas Paine’s Common Sense, the police, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence. But that badge is no licence to transgress the boundaries of civility, decorum, or moral sensibilities of society. Nor should it trash the reciprocal doctrine of the social contract.
Horrific atrocities
Yet, today, police trigger sends chills down our spines. Their horrific atrocities meted out on the citizenry are well documented. The public’s attitude towards the police is not fantasy. It’s informed by daily tragic experiences.
Nothing forms attitudes better than experience. We must appreciate that attitudes are nuanced and complex psychological conceptions that take time to establish but also can’t be wished away at a whim.

Reconstructing the public image of the police will take time and will be discomfiting to a sect that benefits from the current paralysis.
The blotted image of the police is systemic and historical. To change the negative attitudes, the police must also change. It means the public must experience a fresh congenial, but firm Police Service. An unimpeachable system truly living to its mantra of ‘Utumishi kwa Wote’.
