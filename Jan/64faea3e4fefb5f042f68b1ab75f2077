Most governors, MCAs, CECs, Chief Officers and even junior staff became affluent overnight.The looting that took place in the first 5 years of devolution is incomparable. We have focused more on the central government to the extent of failing to take notice of the seemingly failed project that is devolution.
The latter was one of the defining features of the Kenya Constitution 2010, having been premised upon bringing services closer to citizens as well as promoting parity in matters development.

Evidently, most devolved units have since made some strides. Also, there is consensus that not all devolved functions received commensurate funding. Regardless, there are legion reasons to believe that our devolved units have not demonstrated prudent utilisation of resources allocated, much less, provided efficient public service proportionate to the resources availed. Two reasons inform this unfortunate reality.
First, most county governments were founded on weak systems of resource management. Instructively, they woke up to colossal monies which they couldn’t immediately figure out what they were meant for. In reaction, officers went to fetch harvesting baskets. The looting that took place in the first 5 years of devolution is incomparable.

Mischievous ‘idlers’
Most governors, MCAs, CECs, Chief Officers and even junior staff became affluent overnight. Contracts were not only awarded corruptly, but done so at inflated costs. County offices were abuzz with mischievous ‘idlers’ – shady tenderpreneurs, brokers, cronies, and even mistresses – all craving for a share of the new-found largesse.
Relatives and cronies of county officers were not left behind, as each jostled to be placed ‘somewhere’, even if it meant being hired to offer morning prayers.

Off-road vehicles
Then followed the official expenditure. It began with acquisition of high end cars for governors’ offices. Other departments would follow, each going for the latest off-road vehicles – even in areas where road network wasn’t a problem.
MCAs and other officers joined the bandwagon, maximising on sitting allowances and aimlessly globetrotting in the name of benchmarking.
I recall an occasion when MCAs from my county, Vihiga, toured Israel – a dessert – to go learn farming. We are still waiting for the fruits of the excursion.
Second, there seem to be no definite command of power, much less a structure of administration, in most counties. For instance, CECs and Chief Officers have been known to defy Deputy Governors. Similarly, some governors don’t go along with their deputies.
Service delivery
Such poisoned work environments militate against service delivery. The worst is a practice where county staff deliberately undermines each other so that the victims – including governors – get pushed out on flimsy grounds. It is no wonder that most county governments are battling endless labour-related court cases which could easily be avoided.
Whereas counties experience delays of transfer of funds from the Treasury, many haven’t that they could do better if funded in good time.

});
}, 62000);
}



Further, their overreliance on Treasury paints them not as governments but mere departments. Governments function on taxes; but county governments have failed to initiate innovative ideas which can empower residents, consequently making them responsible tax payers.

});
}, 62000);
}



Further, the paltry collections are marred with pilferage. Worse, county assemblies have largely failed to offer oversight, but instead excelled in interfering with, nay, blackmailing the executive, in a bid to achieve selfish gain. Meanwhile, Wanjiku remains stranded between two levels of governments.

The county’s Department of Health has already held meetings with education officials from both the national and county governments.
