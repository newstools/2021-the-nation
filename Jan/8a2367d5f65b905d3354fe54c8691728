In days of yore, once a teacher got his education degree from the university, he got a nice letter from the Teachers Service Commission.
The letter was never detailed but it told one just which school to report to and how much their annual earnings would be. The salary would be in Kenyan pounds and many have never known why to this day.

});

}



Those willing to take up the job would report to the said schools and start their profession. There were those that never bothered to teach and they had the choice to go for other careers. Those were rather good times for graduates.
Those times are gone and these days, there is a glut of qualified teachers and recruitment has been localised. The commission advertises the posts to be filled in each county as per the needs and thousands upon thousands apply for them.



if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("desktop-article-ad-1");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



The marking scheme for the interviews is rather fair and the oldest candidates are somehow favoured by this. The rationale is that they have spent longer time tarmacking than the fresh graduates. The result is that a teacher may begin work at the ripe age of 35 years.
This is not good at all, but the whole country has serious unemployment problems, which may not be solved in a while to come.
Of late, it is getting ghastly. What happens is that locals in the surrounding schools feel that their ‘people’ should get these jobs and not the competing ‘outsiders’. Picture a situation where 4,000 people have applied for a post of teacher of English and Literature in a certain school.
There are local graduates there with the required qualifications, but are flooded with the other thousands from God knows where, who surely will be more qualified than them.



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Local politics
This is where local politics and tribalism takes centre stage. The machinations are done in the dark of the night and on the morning of the interviews, irate locals attack the ‘foreign’ candidates with whips, causing panic and running. The injuries will deter many of the thousands, thus increase the chances of their own taking up the job.
This crude method has now been applied in three counties and soon it shall spread elsewhere. Poor teachers are chased away like dogs and whipped in their backs mercilessly, simply because they wish to secure employment. This primitivity is new and if not checked now before it grows malignant, will soon become the norm.
The second disadvantage with it is the politics of delocalised teachers. They, too, shall not sit comfortable where the locals simply do not want them.
Those teachers employed in the 1980s and 1990s may not know what the younger generation is going through. Teaching was a calling for them and they chose it. It has become something else these days and the future is getting even scarier.
The commission must come up with new recruitment strategy that shall stop this practice, as well as remain fair and above board. It will be a very good thing for the profession, which is becoming something else and not worth being referred to as a calling.
