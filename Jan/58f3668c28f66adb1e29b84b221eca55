My wish for you in 2021 is to rediscover the power of vulnerability.Start with asking or answering the question, “How are you?” How do you become whole again after trauma breaks you open? This poignant question formed part of an interview with Michaela Coel, the writer of I May Destroy You, an unnerving show which dramatises her sexual assault. The story was featured in Vulture.com.
I think the answer to becoming whole again lies in sincerely answering the question, “How are you?

My invitation to you in 2021 is to ask this question to your friends, colleagues, family and even strangers. And if you are convinced “Fine” is an inadequate answer, don’t be shy to probe, cajole and use any means necessary to extract a truthful response. 
I fell prey to the word "Fine" once and it nearly cost me my sanity. In September 2020, I was abducted and robbed at gunpoint. The ordeal lasted just a few hours but the trauma inflicted will probably stay with me for a lifetime. I was physically unharmed. But as I came to learn, sometimes the invisible wounds are more painful than physical ones.

});
}, 62000);
}



I started seeing a counsellor a few days after the incident. And it was only after I sincerely answered her question, "How are you?" after weeks of counselling that she recommended I see a psychiatrist.
I was not okay but felt an imagined pressure to display strength even when I was feeling like the weight of the world was sitting on my shoulders. 
Post-traumatic stress disorder
The psychiatrist diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a terrifying event. I was relieved to finally have a label for the flashbacks, anxiety attacks, stress, irritability and insomnia that had plagued me for weeks on end.

});
}, 62000);
}



My relief was momentary as I was immediately forced to reckon with the new reality: dependence on medication to keep me “normal”. Like Susannah Cahalan in her memoir Brain on Fire, I felt tethered to my pills.
She aptly describes how they “embodied contemptible dependence”. As a Miss Independent crown holder, I felt the same way. It was not until I embraced vulnerability as a strength and not a weakness that I truly began my healing.
“How are you?” invites the subject to accept his or her fallibility as a human in a world that celebrates perfection. The woman who cried: "Sirikal saidia!" years back after her house was swept away by floods was answering the question, "How are you?" in the sincerest way possible.
And she was probably better off than the mother who cries herself to sleep, wondering if she should take her own life and her children's to save them from the indignity of poverty. 
Kenyans pride themselves in being resilient people, often taking the curve balls life throws at them in their stride. But sometimes this resilience can stand in the way of wellbeing. 
My wish for you in 2021 is to rediscover the power of vulnerability. Start with asking or answering the question, “How are you?”
