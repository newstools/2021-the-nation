Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is not going down alone. He has never before and this will not be the first time he is doing so. 

The former Makadara MP has now dragged the First Family in his current woes as he refuses to go down without a fight in his flailing attempts to claw back lost power. 

Known for his fancy recording fingers, the former City Hall boss has now unleashed a phone conversation recording lifting the lid on behind the scenes manouevres preceding his impeachment by Nairobi MCAs on December 3, 2020.

});
}, 62000);
}




This came immediately after a Nairobi anti-corruption court declined his spirited attempts to file a cross petition seeking to block vetting of Nairobi Disaster Management Chief Officer Anne Mwenda as deputy governor as well as setting aside recent cabinet reorganisation by acting Governor Benson Mutura.

});
}, 62000);
}




In the application, the former Makadara MP had listed petitioner Peter Agoro, Ms Mwenda, Nairobi County Assembly, acting Governor Mr Mutura and clerk of the Nairobi County assembly as respondents in the case. Ms Kenyatta and Ms Weru have been listed as interested parties.  

Ms Weru is part of the a shortlist of four female candidates Mr Sonko sometimes after the resignation of Mr Polycarp Igathe as deputy governor in 2018 said he will consider for the position. The others included Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, Karen Nyamu and businesswoman Agnes Kagure. 

President Kenyatta's sister 

In the sworn affidavit by his lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Mr Sonko claimed that Ms Christina Pratt Kenyatta, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s elder sister, contacted him prior to his impeachment seeking his favour of appointment of Ms Jane Weru as Nairobi deputy governor. 

To prove his accusations, Mr Kinyanjui said his client will rely on the transcript of the said conversation in proof of the averments of the allegations as well as production of the recording of the conversation.

“Ms Weru is the person recommended by Christine Pratt Kenyatta to Mr Sonko to assume the role and capacity of the Nairobi County Governor immediately prior to unlawful and sham impeachment of the cross petitioner by reason of which she is a relevant party,” read in part the affidavit. 

In the leaked audio recording, a female voice can be heard telling Mr Sonko that the President was to talk to him about a possible nomination of Ms Weru as deputy governor to replace Mr Polycarp Igathe who had resigned in 2018. 

“Tell him (President Kenyatta) that I am the one who brought her and by that, he will remember. I told him that I brought her and recommended her to you,” said the female caller. 

Mr Sonko, in turn, said he had no problem with the proposition as long as the boss (the President) is aware of the issue. Sonko challenges the DPP to explain why company directors were dropped from the Sh357 million corruption case involving him and others. The former governor wants any possible vetting of Ms Mwenda stopped. Judge allows withdrawal of petition that had blocked Ms Ann Mwenda from being vetted. The ICC has the authority to hear cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed in the 123 countries, including Uganda. In December, TSC failed to attend a negotiation meeting called by Labour CS Simon Chelugui to mediate the two parties.
