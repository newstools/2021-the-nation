Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti has been drawn into a curious land battle in which the High Court declined to award the prime property along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway to any of the parties laying claim to it.
Tinek Limited and its director Abdinoor Shariff Ahmed have accused Ms Ndeti and a relative of hers identified as Peter Nzuki Ndeti of colluding with the National Land Commission (NLC) to fraudulently acquire the five acres in Athi River.

Mr Ahmed and his company claim that the NLC left them out of a hearing that was to determine the property’s owner and awarded it to Mr Nzuki, who was partially represented in the hearings by Ms Ndeti.
While court papers state that Mr Nzuki and the Transport CAS are related, they do not specify how.
Ms Ndeti’s late father was also called Mr Peter Nzuki Ndeti but the Nation was yet to establish whether he is the same individual in the Athi River land saga. The land is currently valued at over Sh400 million. Part of the land is set to be acquired by the government to pave way for the dualling of the Athi River-Machakos highway.





Two years ago, Mr Ahmed sued at the High Court claiming that he bought the land in 2004 and had subdivided it into 18 plots, one of which has been leased to petroleum dealer Engen.
Tinek Limited
The NLC in its defence said that its decision was based on a claim by Mr Nzuki that he has occupied the land since 1960 alongside a woman identified as Elizabeth Nzili Ndeti.
On May 8, 2020, Justice Oscar Angote quashed the NLC’s decision to award Mr Nzuki the property, but also revoked the title deed held by Tinek Limited.
Justice Angote’s decision has left the ownership of the land in limbo, as both parties claiming ownership have lost their respective bids.

}



Mr Ahmed and Tinek Limited have, however, challenged Justice Angote’s ruling at Court of Appeal.
Apart from being declared the legal owner, Tinek and Mr Ahmed are looking to have the NLC compelled to pay them Sh197 million as compensation for part of the land that is set to be acquired for dualling of the Athi River-Machakos highway.
Trouble started in 2016 when Mr Nzuki filed a complaint with the NLC, claiming that his land had been irregularly acquired by Mr Ahmed and Tinek Limited.
At the time, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) was on the verge of paying Tinek Limited Sh197 million as compensation for the parcels that would be acquired compulsorily acquired.
Dispute
The NLC was to hear the dispute on January 27, 2016 but the proceedings were adjourned to November 4 same year.
On the new hearing date, Mr Ahmed filed an objection stating that Tinek Limited was an innocent purchaser for value and that since 2004, it had never received a complaint about ownership.
Mr Ahmed said he acquired the land by buying all the shares in Tinek Limited. On July 16, 2017, when the matter was to proceed, Mr Nzuki said he was bereaved.
Mr Ahmed and his lawyers went to NLC offices on the same day and met with then vice chairperson Abigael Mbagaya.

});
}, 62000);
}



After insisting that no hearing had been held, Ms Mbagaya called Ms Ndeti in the presence of Mr Ahmed. She told Mr Ahmed that he should discuss the case with Ms Ndeti. Mr Ahmed says in court papers that he was surprised to learn of a gazette notice quashing his title deed on November 9, 2018. He adds that even Mr Nzuki was unaware that there was a hearing or a decision made in the matter.

});
}, 62000);
}



The gazette notice stated that the NLC had made a ruling on April 27, 2017— three months before the first hearing was conducted.
NLC insisted in court that it held a hearing on January 26, 2016 and that Tinek Limited and Mr Ahmed provided their evidence and version of events.
Provide evidence
The agency added that its decision followed Tinek Limited’s failure to provide evidence of initial allocation.
In the High Court, Tinek filed a letter of allotment issued to a woman identified as Lucy Njeri Mwangi in 1990 in respect of the same land.
But the title deed issued to Tinek Limited indicated that the land was first registered to the firm.
Justice Angote ruled that the inconsistency was an indication that Tinek Limited’s title deed is irregular.  The Court of Appeal has now suspended the execution of Justice Angote’s judgment until it has determined the challenge.

Tinek Limited told Justices Jamila Mohammed, Sankale Ole Kantai and Milton Asike-Makhandia that failure to suspend execution of the High Court judgment could see the land transferred to third parties before the appeal is determined.
