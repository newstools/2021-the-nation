But President Kenyatta’s statement at the burial of the ANC leader’s mother is likely to put the Western unity to test once again, a community that has long been considered disunited.There has been speculation that he could be the secret candidate for President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The declaration by President Uhuru Kenyatta that it is time other tribes ruled Kenya has sent western Kenya bigwigs back to the drawing board, with those allied to Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi interpreting it to mean his endorsement by the Head of State. 

Mr Mudavadi’s allies have swiftly moved into action and are planning a sitting with him to urge him to fully take advantage of the President’s ‘endorsement’. They also intend to advise him on how to enhance his relationship with Mr Kenyatta.

But President Kenyatta’s statement at the burial of the ANC leader’s mother is likely to put the Western unity to test once again, a community that has long been considered disunited. 

While Ford-Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula, Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and a host of Western MPs have declared that they are walking closely with the ANC leader, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNACTAD) Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi could present a headache to the unity bid as he has hinted that he will also go for the top seat. 






There has been speculation that he could be the secret candidate for President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. 

Back Mudavadi 

But currently, Dr Kituyi’s alleged candidature cannot be felt on the ground. Dr Kituyi, who has held the UN position since September 2013 after he quit active politics, will be completing his tour of duty at UNCTAD in July 2021, a year to the next General Election. 

But following the President’s remarks in Mululu on Saturday, Dr Kituyi’s critics have told him to back Mr Mudavadi. "For long, the Mulembe nation has been divided..," said former minister and Webuye MP Musikari Kombo. "Anyone who wants to come to Western should speak to Musalia first, and this is not being tribal."

However, Mr Mudavadi’s critics see him as too soft for the top-seat race. 

But on Saturday, his allies said his demeanour is his strength and selflessness, which make him the right candidate for 2022. 

Selfless man 

"Mudavadi is selfless. He walked with Uhuru in 2002 and lost. In 2017, he was with us in Nasa and we lost. I humbly ask Uhuru to support this selfless man for the presidency in 2022," said Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa. 

Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja said his political contract with President Kenyatta ends in 2022,, adding that he will then use his experience as former TNA national chairman to campaign for Mr Mudavadi, whom he said has national acceptance. 

Mr Odinga claimed that he had intended to declare Mr Mudavadi the National Rainbow Coalition presidential candidate in 2002 before the latter decamped back to Kanu just before polls. 

Mr Odinga said the return of Mr Mudavadi to Kanu complicated his plans, forcing him to declare "Kibaki Tosha", a declaration that propelled Mwai Kibaki to an unassailable victory in the polls that saw Kanu lose power for the first time since 1963.  But the spirited and renewed efforts by Mr Mudavadi’s troops over the 2022 bid appear to be rubbing Mr Odinga's allies the wrong way.

Kisumu Governor Prof Anyang' Nyong'o dismissed Mr Mudavadi’s candidature, rubbishing it as “simplistic solutions for complex problems.” 






Siaya Senator James Orengo said Kenya should be allowed to go through the unity process that was started by President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga through the March 2018 handshake. 

Senate Majority Leader Samwel Poghisio said the people of Western want the presidency, but whether they are ready to hold Mr Mudavadi’s hand is another question altogether. 

Mr Wamalwa urged the Luhya leaders “to mean what they say and say what they mean”, while Baringo Senator Gideon Moi said, f realised, the Luhya unity would be the community’s victory and ticket to the political high table. Remarks on Saturday seem to confirm that he will not back Ruto but look elsewhere. Murathe says the region is open to supporting candidates from other regions. Allies want him to name his successor as region’s kingpin in order to tame Ruto’s growing influence in his political backyard. The ODM leader says Kenya is a multi-ethnic society, hence the need to be sensitive to the ethnic differences. Experts are concerned about the rapid spread of new variants of the virus.
