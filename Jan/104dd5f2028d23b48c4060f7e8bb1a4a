Earlier on Friday, the opposition leader said the election had seen "widespread fraud and violence", but remained positive as votes were counted under an internet blackout. Ugandan presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, says the military has taken over his home, following a tense election in the country.
Amid the vote count on Friday, he wrote on Twitter, "We are under siege. The military has jumped over the fence and has now taken control of our home. None of these military intruders is talking to us. We are in serious trouble. We are under siege."

The army and police dismissed Wine's claims, saying he had not been arrested and that they were merely protecting him.
"It is true that police and other security agencies are around his premises ... outside, not inside his home, but that is basically to ensure security in the area," Kampala Metropolitan Deputy Police Spokesperson Luke Owoyesigyire  told NTV Uganda.
"He is not under arrest. We have just provided security in the area. Nothing much."

Mr  Owoyesigyire further said two people tried to jump over Wine's fence but that they stepped in and arrested one while the other escaped.
He added that another person, who knocked on the gate but had not been invited to the home, was arrested for interrogation about his intentions.
"If we find they are no threat to the honourable and the home, they will be released."
Election fraud claim
Earlier on Friday, the opposition leader said the election had seen "widespread fraud and violence", but remained positive as votes were counted under an internet blackout.
"Despite the widespread fraud and violence experienced across the country earlier today, the picture still looks good. Thank you, Uganda, for turning up and voting in record numbers," Wine tweeted shortly after midnight, managing to bypass the blockage.

The 38-year-old former popstar-turned-lawmaker did not give details about his accusations.
President Yoweri Museveni is seeking a sixth term in office, and Wine is his main competitor among 11 opposition candidates. Incumbent leader makes leap towards sealing stay in office beyond 35 years after he steadily stretched lead over ten other candidates eyeing country’s presidency. The internet remained down for a third day as vote counting continued in the country. Mr Museveni leads with 4,340,134 million votes against NUP presidential candidate, Bobi Wine’s 2,164,347 votes. Ugandan opposition leader rejects early results which gave President Yoweri Museveni a wide lead as a "joke".
