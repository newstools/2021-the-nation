"The meeting came in response to Sudan's call for giving the AU experts a greater role to facilitate the talks among Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia to contribute to preparation of a second document for the proposed memorandum of agreement that was received by the three countries in the previous six-party meeting," it noted.
It said the meeting thoroughly discussed the importance of setting up a clear reference framework for the role of the AU experts, adding that Sudan has stressed the necessity that the AU plays a more effective leadership role than its role in the previous rounds of talks.

} The Sudanese negotiators believe that the GERD talks should go beyond the level of irrigation ministers. Previous three-way talks have failed to produce an agreement.
