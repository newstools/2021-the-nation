The Amani National Congress (ANC) party has issued a strongly-worded statement demanding that Deputy President William Ruto resign from government or face impeachment over what it says is his sustained criticism of the Jubilee administration and the agendas of President Uhuru Kenyatta.
ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula on Tuesday said that Dr Ruto’s remarks on Sunday criticising calls for a rotational presidency as advocated for by President Kenyatta, was the epitome of the disobedience and disrespect to the Head of State.

Mr Savula said the Musalia Mudavadi-led party has already crafted articles of impeachment against Dr Ruto should he fail to resign, while accusing him of promoting ethnic antagonism and discord among Kenyans.
The Lugari MP said that the DP had abdicated his as the president’s deputy by championing agendas different from those of Mr Kenyatta.

“Ruto swore to serve the people of Kenya diligently by assisting the President prosecute government agenda. But Ruto has deviated, nay, subverted his oath of office loyally to serve the President. Just this Sunday, Ruto has the shameless knack to call the President, his boss, a tribalist,” Mr Savula said.
Dr Ruto had on Sunday hit back at the President over remarks that the presidency had become the property of just two tribes, arguing that such statements could stoke ethnic chaos and lock some Kenyans from seeking elective positions.
The DP, who had been accompanied by MPs and leaders allied to his tanga tanga wing of the Jubilee party, said that all Kenyans, should be allowed to vie for any political seat irrespective of their background, ethnicity of social status, adding that his decision to campaign for the president was based on an agenda for the country and not his tribe.

But Mr Savula, alongside a group of MPs from the ANC party including Vihiga County woman representative Beatrice Adagala, said the statements by the DP, were the epitome of hypocrisy.
“Towards this end, we have taken the lead in preparing a motion of impeachment to protect Kenya against violent,” said Mr Savula.
Ms Adagala said: “In that impeachment motion, we will make the case that because his ambition is in competition with the priorities of the government he serves in, he is in danger to the stability of the nation by covertly dissenting and sabotaging the president’s agenda.”
The leaders also cited the DP’s opposition to BBI, and asked him to instead help the President unite the country. Leaders bow to pressure from Ruto allies on Coast party ahead of 2022 elections. The ODM leader says Kenya is a multi-ethnic society, hence the need to be sensitive to the ethnic differences.
