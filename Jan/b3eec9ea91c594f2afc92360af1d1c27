The family will meet daily at Accra Hotel, which the mayor owned, to make the funeral arrangements.
“We plan to give him his final rest at Kamiti where he bought land for his home. It should be Friday or Saturday this week,” said Mr Mwangi.
The 32-year-old said his father had been sick since March 2020, when the tumour was discovered. He underwent a surgery the same month but fell sick again hence his readmission.
“He is survived by a wife, two sons, two daughters and two grandchildren,” Mr Mwangi said.





Man of the people
Mr Mwangi described his father as a lively person with a good sense of humour and a man of the people who mingled with people of all ages.
“However, he was strict and would reproach you when you were in the wrong. He was also business-oriented and had investments apart from the famous Accra Hotel,” he said.
King'ori's grandchild, Caroline Macharia, remembered him as a black belt karateka.
“He had a gym at Accra Hotel where he trained even while sick. He carried dumbbells to Nairobi Hospital,” she said.
King’ori served as the mayor of the defunct Nairobi City County Council between 1994 and 1996.
He took over from Mayor Steve “Magic” Mwangi, becoming the eighth Kenyan mayor of the capital city.

He was succeeded by Dick Waweru Mbugua. Some students, mostly Form Ones, fell into septic tanks while escaping from police. A group of MCAs stormed into the offices of the county secretary and chief finance officer, demanding explanations. The pardon came after his meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart Sahle-Work Zewde, who is on an official tour of Tanzania. The cases failed to kick off to allow prime suspect Lawrence Njoroge Warunge to undergo a mental exam. The country has raised security concerns after Somalia’s federal and regional forces renewed fighting at Bula Hawa in the Gedo region.
