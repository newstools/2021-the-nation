The 47-year-old daughter of Methodist ministers first ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, a race she lost by 55,000 votes.Her loss was attributed to wanton voter suppression in Georgia, that is, deliberate laws and efforts to ensure that a certain portion of the population (mostly blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans) did not vote. As the US political temperatures reach an all-time high with post-election violence that saw Pro-Trump supporters breach the Capitol on Wednesday, history was being made in the state of Georgia.
Georgia, a state that was traditionally Republican formally turned Blue, first by voting for Joe Biden in the presidential race and then electing two democrats to senate, Rev Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in a tight race that conjured up memories of the November presidential election.

In the midst of this historic moment, one woman’s name keeps coming up — Stacey Abrams — the person who made all this possible and the one woman who entirely deserves all the credit. Stacey is an African American organiser and currently the most influential American not in elected office.

When she lost the race many, including myself, were heartbroken. It was a deeply hurtful experience, especially because of all the effort she had put in new voter registration though her grassroots organisation, The New Georgia Project, which she founded in 2013.
Sacrifice
 It appeared that all the hard work and sacrifice had come to a screeching halt. Instead of disappearing into the shadows, Ms Abrams ruminated over her loss and then decided to keep going. “I sat Shiva for 10 days… then I started plotting,” she says in a profile published in the Vogue.
After her loss, she founded Fair Fight, a civil society organisation that educates young and minority voters on their voting rights. Come 2020 elections, Georgia saw a heavy turnout of voters — most of whom were newly registered, thanks to her efforts —who voted for Biden, effectively changing the direction of American politics in profound ways.

In other words, Ms Abrams laid the foundation and the infrastructure to change voter patterns in the Deep South, setting the stage for Biden’s win.
After watching her documentary All In on Amazon Prime, I can only admire Abrams for her resilience. But what remains most important to me in this Abrams story is how she dealt with her failure.
We would have forgiven her is she chose to give up and walk away, but she is cut from a different cloth. She used her failure as a learning opportunity and a turnaround moment. What we are seeing in Georgia is a culmination of 10 years of backbreaking work that might never have materialised had she decided 2018 was the end.
And now, with this win and national recognition, Abrams is one of the most powerful Americans, even without an elective position and the definition of leading without a title.
