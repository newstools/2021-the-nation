Elections constitute a vital element in a liberal democracy like ours. They are a viable means of ensuring orderly succession and change and an instrument of political authority and legitimation.
The current wave of democratic enthusiasm ahead of the 2022 General Election, however, has evoked a hyped competition with a section of the political axis coining a mobilisation campaign hinged on a ‘Hustler versus Dynasty’ clarion call. That is dangerous.

The proponents of the narrative say a small group of families (“dynasties”) have taken a massive amount of the wealth Kenyan workers have produced while the masses (“hustlers”) have been hollowed out. This suggestion that the wealthy are not entitled to what they own is as dangerous as it is ridiculous. It feeds a silly notion that the ‘haves’ made their bundles by nefarious means that other Kenyans are unable to use or access, and that in Kenya talent, hard work, ingenuity, perseverance and education do not pay.





Some 800 years ago, St Thomas Aquinas identified envy as one of the seven deadly sins, noting: “Charity rejoices in our neighbour’s good while envy grieves over it.” If we continue to listen to and entertain the “hustler” narrative, envy could well be the death of our economy, democracy and society.
The proponents of the narrative have incited their reactionary base with conspiracies, untruths and incendiary rhetoric. And the consequences of the violent scenes will be felt across the country as 2022 approaches.
Class wars are very dangerous. When the real “hustlers” hijack it, they will overrun even those who started it. And it’s happening: Motor vehicles belonging to innocent people have been torched over claims of belonging to “dynasties”. The writing is on the wall. Let those who have eyes see and ears hear.

It is essentially a red herring. First and foremost, the problem in this country is not “dynasties” per se. It is corruption. That is what must be eradicated. Kenyans shouldn’t be too quick to buy such. It is immoral and irresponsible to radicalise the youth with a misleading notion that the rich or anyone who is well-off is the reason why they are poor.
Soon, one will not be able to drive their small car on the road. Those who do not have a motorcycle will dub those who own one a dynasty. Your small retail shop or dairy cow will earn you a space in the list of dynasties. The narrative is fast mutating and melting down into our society and family unit.
Soon, it won’t be about imaginary “hustlers” but a Wanjala in Bungoma who thinks his brother is a ‘dynasty’ because he owns a parcel of land and he does not, and a Kiptoo in Bureti who thinks that by owning a cow in the village, his neighbour is a ‘dynasty’.
Contrary to historical documentation, what appears to be a class revolt in Kenya is being led by the political and financial bourgeoisie. As it were, the French Revolution was a watershed event in modern history that was pioneered by the proletariat. They unleashed the bloody Reign of Terror (la Terreur) — 10 months when suspected enemies of the revolution were guillotined in their thousands.

Most African countries face a violent future due to greed for power.  A decade ago this month, protests forced Tunisia’s authoritarian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to flee his country. What began as a class revolt would engulf the Middle East, topple governments and unleash consequences that persist to date. But in Egypt, events didn’t turn out as envisioned. Thousands are said to have fled the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi that is considered even more oppressive than the deposed Mohamed Morsi’s.
No doubt, the politics of caste, corruption, wealth and ‘Hustler versus Dynasty’ in Kenya is a poisoned chalice. Those watering its roots should be wary of a fire-breathing dragon that would consume Kenya and Africa faster than we can imagine.
The ‘Hustler versus Dynasty’ narrative is, indeed, a dangerous one with the potential of degenerating into anarchy. We need to understand that class warfare is a mortal enemy of economic growth and democracy. At the very least, class warfare means “anarchy”. Deputy President expresses confidence that his Jubilee faction will lead the next government. ACK provost says a class war between the ''hustlers'' and the "dynasty" has begun brewing. DP Ruto accused of coming up with new pledges without fulfilling earlier promises. A spot check by Nation on Tuesday found no signs of the cross slab. BBI Bill to be tabled in all the counties after IEBC verified 1.14 million signatures.
