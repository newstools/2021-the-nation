The 19-time league champions' preparations for the match had been marred by players' strikes due to non payment of two months salary arrears and that played it's part on the pitch, as K'Ogalo players lacked morale to fight on the pitch after Belouizdad's equaliser.Ulimwengu scored from a low shot past CR Belouizdad's goalie Gaya Merba just inside the box in the 22nd minute after receiving a complete pass from Samuel Onyango on the left.

The record champions went into the game with a huge task of overturning the  heavy defeat, but had more misery piled on them after the Algerians scored late goals.
Gor had taken an early lead through Burundian Jules Ulimwengu in the 22nd minute, but lethal goal poacher Amir Sayoud and second half substitute  Abdelkader Belharane each scored in 72nd and 85th minutes respectively to gift the away team the win.

Ulimwengu scored from a low shot past CR Belouizdad's goalie Gaya Merba just inside the box in the 22nd minute after receiving a complete pass from Samuel Onyango on the left.
The goal brought high expectations from the handful of fans at the stadium who believed 'Juogi' (spirits) were on their side and could make it possible for Gor to overturn the deficit, but it did not according to script.
CR Belouizdad, under the tutelage of French tactician Franck Dumas, got their equaliser through a well-taken free kick by Sayoud outside the box in 72nd minute after John Macharia had committed a foul outside the box.

Gor will now be relegated to the playoffs of the less prestigious CAF Confederation Cup where they will also have to sweat it out against tough opponents to qualify for the group stage.
The Algerians were the first to threaten and squandered a glorious chance to go a head  just 10 minutes into the game when Sayoud, who bagged a hatrick in the first leg, had his low range shot easily grabbed by K'Ogalo custodian Gad Mathews.
Determined to cut the deficit, K'Ogalo proved impressive and took control of the midfield. Clifftone Miheso's  left foot shot in the 18th minute caught CR Belouizdad off guard and Merba had to punch the ball inches outside the field of play.
The Algerians however found their foot in the match and missed a clear chance to equalise in the 30th minute after winger Larbi Tabti dribbled past Michael Apudo with only Mathews to beat, but shot wide.
Captain Kenneth Muguna wasted another good chance to score the second five minutes to the break, with his long range shot blocked by Belouizdad's centre back and captain Chemseddine Nessakh.
Just 15 minutes to halftime, Gor Mahia stand in coach Sammy 'Pamzo' Omollo brought in Malawian import Andrew Malisero for Clifftone Miheso to reinforce the midfield and fire more ball upfront for Onyango and Ulimwengu.

Malisero, who was making his debut since joining K'Ogalo, however had minimal impact due to the manning prowess of the Algerian midfielders.

Despite dominating the local league, Gor Mahia have found it tough in the continental scene in the recent years. K'Ogalo failed to qualify for the group stage of the competition in the 2019/20 season after being thrashed by Algerian giants, USM Algiers 6-1 on aggregate.
The team will now focus on recruiting a new tactician after the exit of 60-year-old Brazilian coach, Roberto Oliveira and his assistant Patrick Odhiambo. CR Belouizdad captain Chemseddine Nessakh said they are ready to pile more misery on K’Ogalo. Former champions Umeme Bees also suffered the same fate. Senior specialists among those affected.

Keen to expand his support base, Dr Ruto, backed by his allies, has gone full-blown to challenge his main political opponents.
