Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has dismissed claims that she has abandoned her aspirations for the county’s governor seat in the 2022 elections.
Ms Wanga said Wednesday that she is among the top contenders for the seat.
She said she will not vie for a parliamentary seat as claimed by her opponents.

Critics of the Woman Rep have been telling Homa Bay residents that she is no longer interested in the seat is considering to extend her term as a lawmaker.
Ms Wanga was speaking after the launch of a road project in Rangwe Constituency. She also inspected other projects in the area alongside MP Lilian Gogo.
"I have a dream of serving Homa Bay residents as a governor and I have already been endorsed by different groups who want me to be their county chief," Ms Wanga said.
On Wednesday, Ms Wanga also distributed grants to small-scale traders in the county courtesy of a programme dubbed ‘Abedo’ that is partly funded by the National Government Affirmative Action fund (NGAAF).





Governor Awiti has allegedly been pushing Ms Wanga to stay in Parliament where she will hopefully be appointed as a Cabinet Secretary if the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report is passed.
According to the Governor, Homa Bay would lose representatives at the national level if Ms Wanga, ODM National Chairman John Mbadi and Senator Moses Kajwang, who are all eying to win the governor seat, concentrate on county politics.
Mr Awiti told the group to maintain their current seats.
Ms Wanga, however, told her supporters that she is not changing her mind and will not be forced to go for other political seats.

"There are people who have told me to go and vie for a political seat in Kisumu County where I was born. A woman belongs to where she is married than where was born," she said, adding that as a woman, she faces a lot of challenges in her political career.
Other politicians who have declared interest to succeed Governor Awiti include former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, Isaiah Ogwe, Kuppet Secretary General Akelo Misori, former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, businessman Jared Kiasa among others.
