"We are pleased to announce the arrival of striker Wilson Silva Fonseca from Fortaleza FC, Brazil," the club posted on its website.
Silva will travel with the team to Mombasa for the BetKing Premier League clash against Bandari on Saturday.
His first match could however be against AFC Leopards in the Mashemeji Derby on February 7.
In 2013 Gor Mahia hit the headlines, signing Brazilian Giovanni Rodriguez but it later emerged that the club was duped into signing a footballer who was not fit and couldn't even juggle the ball at City stadium.





Croatian coach Zdravko Logarusic, who was in charge then, released the player. 
Gor have struggled upfront this season as they have won only four matches and are eighth on the log with 12 points, nine shy of league leaders KCB. They are the new chair and vice chair succeeding Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), respectively. Jubilee party official says BBI was sold in Mount Kenya by force “and Murang'a Senator did nothing bad to highlight these issues to the President.” Minister says new time zone is based on South Sudan’s location on the globe.
