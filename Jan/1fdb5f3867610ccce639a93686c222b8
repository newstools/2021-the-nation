 “The army and police in some places gave people pre-ticked ballot papers in addition to intimidating voters by their presence and influencing the electorate to vote in favor of incumbent president Museveni,” Bobi Wine said.
“We have gathered supporting evidence and it will be availed to the public once internet is restored across the country,” he added.
National army deputy spokesperson Deo Akiiki dismissed the claims calling them ‘malicious’.
“Those claims are aimed at tarnishing the Uganda People’s Defense Force (UPDF),” he said.

“Given the history of the nature of elections in this country, we don’t want to rush but every vote will be accounted for by Saturday and we don’t want to go beyond 48 hours,” he said.
Mr Byabakama responded to Bobi Wine’s claims on cases of electoral malpractice imploring him, “to show how results were released contrary to what was in 34,684 Result Declaration Forms under Kyagulanyi’s custody.” 
‘Bobi Wine home siege’
Presidential candidate Bobi Wine earlier Friday said his home had been surrounded by soldiers.

He said that the incident happened at about 5.30pm and he was not told the reason as to why his home had been surrounded: “When I tried to ask why they have done this, they said I should ask the spokesperson of the military. They are not talking to us,” he said.
Deputy Kampala Metropolitan police spokesperson Luke Owoyesigire confirmed arrests of people with unknown agenda around Bobi’s home.
“It’s true that police and army are within the vicinity of his home and at least 3 anonymous people with unknown intentions have been arrested and are being probed,” he said.
His counterpart in armed forces and deputy army spokesperson Deo Akiiki acknowledged military presence around Bobi’s home.
