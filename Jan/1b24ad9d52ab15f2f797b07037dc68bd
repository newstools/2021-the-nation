And that’s if Santa's reindeers had managed to haul the colossal luggage from wherever ‘Father Christmas’ comes from to this part of the world.

All that didn't happen for the obvious reason that Santa Claus is not real. He is merely a fictional character who pops up every Christmas to spread the cheer, especially for kids, with his bagful of gifts. The Christmas season and the catastrophic year 2020 is now behind us. With the New Year finally here, allow me to indulge in some wishful thinking as far as what Kenyan sport can look forward to in 2021.
So here goes my wish list for Kenyan sports in the New Year:
Clean sport





In recent times, the bane of Kenyan sports has been the increasing cases of top performing athletes who have been caught for doping.
Never before has Kenya’s status and credentials as a global powerhouse been so closely scrutinised than the present times, all thanks to a few rotten apples. All that could change in 2021.
The signing of the Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, 2020 into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on the eve of New Year may just stem the doping tide in Kenya.
Other than its punitive nature, the new law has paved the way for Kenyan athletes to not just participate in major international events, but also compete clean in what should be an action-packed year.
Reversal of Covid damage
This is a dicey one, given that 2020 — to borrow Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha’s words — was a lost year for sports, not just in Kenya, but across the world.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



But there is hope. Covid-19 vaccines which have since been developed in the west will hopefully go a long way in reversing the ruins of the virus, when the vaccines become available.
If 2021 proves to be Covid-19’s waterloo, as we all hope, then sports venues across the world, which were mute for the better part of 2020, will once again reverberate with the familiar sounds of the fans.
End of football circus
For more than half a century, Kenyan football has been plagued by corrupt and incompetent administrators who have never been in short supply in this country.
Successive regimes have used Football Kenya Federation — and its innumerable predecessors — as a cash cow to the detriment of Kenyan football.
But the insolence of the current office-bearers has taken it to a whole new level.
Today, Kenyan football only exists by name; in truth, it’s on its deathbed.
Kenya to the world
Then of course 2021 could yet prove to be a memorable year for Kenyan sportsmen and women.
A number of sporting events which were initially lined up for 2020 will happen this year.
Top of the list is the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the returning WRC Safari Rally (since 2002) and the World Athletics Under-20 Championships in Nairobi. So much to look forward to. Happy New Year!

} Drama ensued early Saturday when the Kanu chair went to Kapsisiywa for coronation as the Kalenjin kingpin. Clinical officers agree to go back to work as more discussions take place, joining doctors who were first to return to work. In the coming months, the “Ruto parties” will avail themselves of a chance to show their mettle.
