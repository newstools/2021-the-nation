Last month, Green Africa Foundation founder Isaac Kalua wrote an article on how Kenya can eradicate poverty. I wish to build on it as regards the role of education in the management of counties and, by extension, combating poverty.
Mr Kalua stated, among others, the fact that devolution has opened up an opportunity to every county to identify in the field of agriculture, marine and livestock development items that they have competitive advantages in over other counties and specialise in exploiting them. Examples include growing mangoes in Makueni and bananas in Kisii.

Secondly, and most importantly, he raised the issue of taking county leaderships into account through measurable changes that can be attributed to them as they work towards raising the standard of living of residents.
Let us go to the basics. Way back in 2003, the Ministry of Planning released data on poverty indices in every location in Kenya except in the then-North Eastern Province.

One would have expected, for example, that from the 2013 elections onwards, the electorate would choose leaders on the basis of their pledges to reduce poverty levels by, say, three per cent, during their five-year tenure in their wards, constituencies and counties, respectively. It is here that the role of education comes in.
Educational qualifications
During the campaigns, the candidates liberally parade their educational qualifications in order to impress the electorate. It is assumed, therefore, that these candidates will use the qualifications to formulate policies and work towards attracting investors in their electoral areas to reduce poverty. 
This should be more applicable to the governor and those individuals who will be assigned devolved functions, such as agriculture and water development.
 I have no training in agriculture, but let me share my experiences. First, when I attended an agricultural show in Paris, I was amazed that farmers from the Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal were exhibiting and selling dry land crops such as tamarind and gooseberry juices.

});
}, 62000);
}



I also attended the Royal Agricultural Show in Birmingham. One entrepreneur was exhibiting the use of aloe vera jelly to treat burns in livestock to full recovery, let alone a myriad other cosmetic and medicinal uses. At an agricultural expo in Tel Aviv, I came across cactus as animal feed with its fruit processed as jam for human consumption.
Back home, an investor from South Africa at one time wanted to lease for 15 years the New KCC factory at Miritini, near Mombasa. The intention was to convert it to process soya paste instead of milk. The investor said that soya grown along the coast between Mozambique and Somalia was of high quality. Given the chance, he would have helped farmers in the coastal districts to plant soya with a ready market from huge military ships that often dock at Mombasa.
Amarula wine
In Eldoret, one investor purchases chili and exports it to Germany but the supply is insufficient. Likewise, there is potential, yet unexplored, for growing marula trees and harvesting the fruits for processing into amarula wine as is done in South Africa, Namibia and Angola. The tree grows in the wild in the counties of Baringo, Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Machakos, Makueni and West Pokot.

All these crops are just but a few of the many crops that grow especially in the arid and semi-arid areas. The governors and their advisers have not paid much attention to work towards exploiting these God-given crops, as is the case in the Sahel countries, Israel and Equatorial countries like Colombia.
In the early 1960s, a French agronomist, Rene Dumont, lamented that agriculture in Africa was taking a false start soon after Independence. Are we witnessing another “false start” in some counties 60 years after the assertion by Mr Dumont?
There may be a strong case for the mindsets of the educated county bosses to be rebooted to think local and act global. Or didn’t their education enable them to focus on opportunities to lift their people out of excruciating poverty through innovative practices?
bksogomo@gmail.com. @BSogomo Ten governors under Cereb have joined the onslaught against him over the BBI's popularity in Mt Kenya. The court has suspended a Gazette notice calling for the Nairobi by-election following a case by impeached Governor Mike Sonko. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age.
