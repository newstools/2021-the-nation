Police have arrested a man who allegedly attacked his estranged wife with machetes in Megenche village leaving her for dead.
Ms Naomy Nyangarisa, 22, is nursing injuries to her head, hands, legs and face after escaping death by a whisker during the gruesome attack on Friday.
When the Nation visited her at Tabaka Mission Hospital where she had been admitted, she was preparing to move to another hospital for specialised treatment.

“We had stayed together for four years, but we parted ways in June last year, and I decided to get married elsewhere,” Ms Nyangarisa said.
She added that the suspect stormed her new home wielding two pangas and attacked her.
 “He first tried to attack my husband and, when I intervened, he hacked me on the hand and both legs,” she said.
Lying helpless
Angry locals turned on the suspect, slashing him on both hands, but he managed to escape. He was later arrested and is held at Tabaka Police Station.

County Police Commander Jebel Monene said officers were informed by locals of a woman, who had been attacked and was lying helpless in her house.
“When we rushed to the scene on Friday, we found a woman with serious cuts on the floor. She was in pain and seemed to be regaining her consciousness,” Mr Monene told the Nation on phone.
With the help of the residents, the police rushed her to Nyangena Hospital but her family failed to raise the Sh10,000 admission fee.
Ms Nyangarisa was later moved to Lenmek Hospital about 20 kilometres away. Globally, 137 women are killed every day with 50 per cent of murders committed by intimate partners.
