The Egerton University Council has appointed Prof Isaac Kibwage as the institution’s acting vice chancellor after the retirement of the embattled VC Rose Mwonya.
Prof Mwonya’s term officially came to an end yesterday after she reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.
But she has moved to court to fight the decision to have her retire, saying she is entitled to serve until she is 74.

The matter is set to come up for hearing on January 14.
The announcement declaring Prof Kibwage as acting VC was communicated to the students and staff in a notice today.
"In exercise of the powers vested in it Section 35 (1) (a) (i) of the University Act No 42 of 2012, as amended in 2016, and after making necessary consultations, Council has the honour of appointing Prof Isaac Ongubo Kibwage, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Administration, Planning and development, as Acting Vice-Chancellor with immediate effect," said Dr Hukka Wario, the Egerton University Council chairperson.

Dr Wario, who signed the notice at the Njoro campus on Wednesday, urged the staff, students, parents and alumni, partners, stakeholders and friends of the university to support Prof Kibwage.
This is the second time Prof Kibwage has being appointed the acting VC of the financially troubled institution, which is reeling in debt of more than Sh3.3billion.
The debtors include pensioners’ funds, Saccos, part-time lecturers, the Kenya Revenue Authority, private hospitals and many other suppliers whose debt has been pending for years.
Prof Kibwage was first appointed as acting VC in November of last year following a circular issued and signed by Dr Thomas Serem, the university’s registrar for human capital and administration.

However, as the power struggle intensified, in December of last year, Prof Mwonya issued a general notice to staff and students and insisted that she was still the VC of Egerton University until further notice. The Nakuru-based institution is enduring arguably its worst financial period in decades. The Njoro-based university’s financial woes and power struggles have reduced it into an arena for power supremacy.
