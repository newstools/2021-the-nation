A Ugandan opposition presidential candidate was arrested Sunday over a traffic offense, police said.
Patrick Oboi Amuriat, the Forum for Democratic Change presidential flag bearer, was arrested for the misdemeanour while campaigning in central Uganda ahead of the January 14 general elections.
Lydia Tumushabe, police spokesperson of the Katonga Region, said in a statement that Amuriat was arrested for consenting to be carried dangerously on the roof of a vehicle, putting his life at risk.

"His arrest came after several warnings from traffic officers," Tumushabe said, noting that he has been detained at a police station in the central district of Mpigi pending completion of inquiries.
Amuriat and incumbent president Yoweri Museveni are the frontrunners among the 11 candidates vying for Uganda's presidency, according to opinion polls.
