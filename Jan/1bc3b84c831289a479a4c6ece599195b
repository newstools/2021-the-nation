Uhuru suspends schools’ co-curricular activities like sports, drama, music and prize-giving for 90 days.Teachers seek ways of juggling between Covid-19 protocols and talent development. Officials of the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) are planning to hold a meeting with Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha to salvage the battered schools sports programmes after the government put them on hold for a further three months in Covid-19 containment measures. 

Peter Orero, the KSSSA chairman, Sunday said while they would not, and cannot, challenge a presidential directive, they will hold a meeting with the Education Cabinet Secretary to give their views on how the school sports programmes could be salvaged.

Orero argued that through sports activities, the immunity of children is boosted and it’s, therefore, the best way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease. 

“We have realised that since the form four classes resumed last year, no student has died and we believe no student will die because of coronavirus,” Orero said, adding that those who are vulnerable are the teachers and support staff that will need to be taken care off.

});
}, 62000);
}




Orero said children have high immunity because of the activities they engage in and that, after all, they have been active in tournaments and several activities and none of them has been adversely effected. 

“We are only praying that the ministry will listen to us because other activities have moved on. 

“We went through health protocols together with all our regional officials and we promise to abide by those protocols so that the activities can continue,” Orero said. 

According to him, there is no way teachers will implement the competency-based curriculum without co-curricular activities. 

He further argued that some of the children depend on co-curricular activities for their future livelihoods. 

“Now that the schools are back, there is no single reason that this activities should not go on but, as an association, we are seeking audience with the ministry so that we explain our part,”  Orero said.

The primary and secondary school games’ organisers suffered the huge blow Sunday after President Uhuru Kenyatta banned extra-curricular activities for the next three months. 

In the Executive Order signed yesterday, the president banned schools’ co-curricular activities like sports, drama, music and prize-giving for 90 days as well as all exchange visits between schools. 

KSSSA had lined up a bevy of activities for the year that would culminate in the country competing in the World School Games in Jinjiang, China, for the first time. 

The East Africa Secondary School Games were also due to return to Kenya after a four-year absence. 

When the first Covid-19 positive case was reported in the country on March 12, Term One Secondary Games were at county level as schools battled for slots for the national games. Last year, the duo were unable to hold a number of their championships. Dignitaries from International Schools Sports Federation and the World School Games had also confirmed attendance in the 19th edition of the championship. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age. Nyeri Town MP Mr Ngunjiri Wambugu said Mr Kang’ata was not sincere in his letter for sharing it with the media and the public. Learning institutions were shut in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
