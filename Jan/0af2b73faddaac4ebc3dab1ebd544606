At Uasin Gishu Primary, 800 out of 1,200 learners reported back. “We have about 85 per cent of Standard Eight learners who reported. We don’t know where the rest are. We fear that some might have given birth some parents also lost jobs and some moved to rural areas, and some of the learners have not travelled back,” said Robert Kamau, a senior teacher at the school.

In Elgeyo-Marakwet, teachers said students reported back in large numbers, making adherence to the social distancing rule impossible.
"On top of the hand washing points, we need hand sanitisers for teachers and students. We also have a shortage of desks, which makes it hard to properly observe the one-metre rule among learners," said Mr David Chesinen, the head teacher in Kabarar Primary, Marakwet West.
Schools in Marakwet East, however,recorded low student turn-out, a situation parents blamed on their readiness to pay fees and provide basic needs for their children.
"Most of our sources of livelihood were affected by floods and mudslides. We are yet to fully recover, thus we have not paid full fees for our children. It will take some time before we are up to the task," said Mr Francis Murkomen, a parent at Wewo in Marakwet East.
