KCB coach Japheth Munala said most of the players are at better place, save for few who will need to shed weight thanks to festive season."We have just begun training well aware of the fixtures ahead of us. This week we will do more of physicals and proceed to ball work as the days progress, but all in all we are optimistic ahead of the season and we can only hope for the best," said Munala , who doubles up as the national women's team assistant coach. Champions Kenya Prisons and KCB women's volleyball teams have begun their preparations in earnest ahead of the first leg of the 2021 Kenya Volleyball Federation National League set for January 23.
Prisons, who are training at the Nairobi West grounds, will however do without the services of experienced right attackerÂ  Loice Jepkosgei, who is on maternity leave.

Prisons will take on Kenya Army, before they cross swords with KCB in what is expected to be the highlight of the league opener.
Prisons assistant coach Azenga Mavisi said there is little to talk about, but was quick to note that they are focusing on the physical and mental aspect of the players.
"We are doing everything possible to ensure we start the season on a high. The two fixtures will be interesting but it goes without saying that the tie against KCB will be one to look out for. It's a full house and we hope to get better as the days goes by," said Mavisi.

In the absence of Jepkosgei, Prisons will rely on the services of lanky Lydia Maiyo, left-handed and national team player Emmaculate Chemutai and Yvonne Wavinya.
While alot is expected from KCB after signing top players from Kenya Prisons and Kenya Pipeline, it will be interesting to see how Mercy Moim and Edith Wisa, who were signed from Prisons, line up against their former employers.
KCB, who will take on Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in another fixture of the day, also brought on board on-form Sharon Chepchumba from the Oilers.
