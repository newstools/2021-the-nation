The health sector can probably be pardoned for not seeing the pandemic coming.But still, this is no excuse for the ministry’s lack of preparation to have enough equipment to avert unforeseen emergencies.  If there is anything that the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed, it’s our lack of preparedness. From our health sector to learning institutions, we have been put to the test.
Unfortunately, we still cannot tell the early warning signs of a crisis. We still lag behind in aligning our systems, which is meant to work for us, not against us.

The health sector can probably be pardoned for not seeing the pandemic coming. But still, this is no excuse for the ministry’s lack of preparation to have enough equipment such as ventilators and hospital beds to avert unforeseen emergencies. 
On the other hand, the Ministry of Education should have prepared schools with more infrastructure and resources. Public schools still struggle with poor facilities like classrooms and toilets. Now, with the pandemic still surging, our lack of preparation may be to our country’s detriment.





Since schools were closed early last year, the Ministry of Education should have put proper measures in place in readiness for reopening. The government had stated that schools would reopen on January 4, but it is appalling to witness the last-minute preparations. 
Preparedness requires collaborative efforts from all stakeholders. It also calls for proper planning and resources allocation to achieve effortless results. The ministries of health and education should ensure that as children resume learning, none will be put at risk of contracting the virus. 
Early preparations
This is not to belittle the efforts done by both ministries so far. If anything, they ought to be applauded for their efforts. However, a lot more could still have been done.

If what we have watched in the news or read in the newspapers is anything to go by, then schools may be sitting on a time bomb if the situation is left unchecked. 
The Education CS Prof Magoha admittedly stated that reopening of schools was largely successful except for the overcrowding and called upon heads of schools to be innovative. It is for this reason that arrangements needed to be in place beforehand.
As key stakeholders, parents should have been consulted on how best they think children could be kept safe before going back to school. It’s no wonder that some are still sceptical about releasing their children to go to school just yet.
It’s not too late to learn from our mistakes and change our tides. It’s also crucial that we normalise early preparedness to prevent crises. This way, we also complement government efforts in tackling challenges that befall us. Indeed, preparedness is the solution to most of our challenges.
