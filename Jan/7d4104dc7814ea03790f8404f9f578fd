Wycliffe Osabwa: With toothless agencies, voter our only hope

In a recent pronouncement, the president of the Law Society of Kenya, Nelson Havi, stated that neither the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Authority (EACC) nor the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has the legal mandate to bar an aspirant from vying for an elective seat.

googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



This was in reference to EACC’s declaration that former Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu was unfit to run in next month’s Nairobi gubernatorial by-election, which was occasioned by the impeachment of Mike Sonko.
Mr Havi’s declaration brings to question the place of the Constitution, state agencies and arms of government as far as issues of integrity are concerned. The LSK chief cited a case where IEBC failed to clear Wavinya Ndeti in the run-up to the 2013 elections, which was overturned by the High Court. This, for him, implied that only the court had the final word.

setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Contextually, one then wonders whether Senate decisions have any import. Instructively, EACC’s decision was based on his impeachment. Logically, IEBC would be expected to follow suit since it partly relies on EACC’s word as far as the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution go.
But should Mr Havi’s position prevail, as ably canvassed by reference to precedence, then the net implication is that both the EACC and IEBC have a mere ceremonial role in the war against corruption. Consequently, their decision to bar anyone from contesting amounts to naught.
Most importantly, it brings to question the significance of impeachment. Can superior courts overturn an impeachment? What does this portend, considering that the Senate is independent and impartial — at least as per the Constitution?



if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {
googletag.cmd.push(function () {
googletag.display("mobile-article-ad-2");
});
setInterval(function refreshAds() {
googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {
googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);
});
}, 62000);
}



Integrity scale
Arguably, Chapter Six complicates the issue. One of the guiding principles of leadership and integrity (Article 73, clause 2(a)), for instance, implies that elected leaders need not be people of integrity: “Selection on the basis of personal integrity, competence and suitability, or election in free and fair elections.”
Seemingly, state officers, who are appointed, are subject to the integrity scale but those to be elected are deemed special, with their integrity being pegged on free and fair elections!
I may be wrong; I am not a legal expert. But I wouldn’t be the only one with a different view. Prof Kithure Kindiki, a lawyer and Tharaka Nithi senator, is of the opinion that the likes of Waititu and Sonko need be barred from contesting. Evidently, the law is never ‘very clear’ after all.
Voters have a critical role of putting the right people into office. Thanks to equivocal laws, we are likely to have all kinds of shady characters on the ballot, yet we may not rely on the concerned state agencies to sieve the dregs from the long cast of aspirants.
Implicitly, the voter remains our only hope. Should they abdicate this noble duty, expect another avalanche of clownish, clueless and corrupt office holders in the name of “elected leaders”.

wosabwa680@gmail.com. Ten governors under Cereb have joined the onslaught against him over the BBI's popularity in Mt Kenya. The court has suspended a Gazette notice calling for the Nairobi by-election following a case by impeached Governor Mike Sonko. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age.
