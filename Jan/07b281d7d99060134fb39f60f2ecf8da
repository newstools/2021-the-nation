Home professional Justus Madoya made full use of his local knowledge to post an impressive four under par 67 to claim the first round lead of the 2020/2021 Safari Tour golf sixth leg series at the par 71 Great Rift Valley Golf Resort course Wednesday.
And it was the first nine which propelled him to the top of the leader board following a clean four under par nine.

“Usually I start poorly and then do recovery bit, but I am happy I started well this time round and I am hoping this is the beginning of a good week," said  Madoya, who made birdies at the at the par four-first, third, fifth and sixth holes.
He started the back nine well though a double-bogey at the par three-15th following an early single bogey at the 13th almost ruined the day for him though he managed to recover with two birdies at the 14th and 16th.





“The course is playing well and probably easy to score if one stays on target and has enough patience for the greens," added Madoya, who said he hopes to build on his opening round with probably better scores in the remaining rounds.
Following Madoya in second place was amateur Adel Balala from Nyali Golf and Country Club Mombasa, who shot one under par 70, despite missing a number of birdie chances particularly at the back nine, where he dropped a shot at the 13th.
He had made two birdies at the front nine’s third and sixth holes, a good foundation, though birdies became elusive at the back nine.
“I hit very good shots at the back nine and was all the time on regulation, but I could make some birdies though I am happy starting on under par score’," said Balala.
