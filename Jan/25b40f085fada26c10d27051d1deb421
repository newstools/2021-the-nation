Two remand prisoners who escaped from custody have been rearrested by police in Kirinyaga County.
They were apprehended in their hideouts in Murang'a after being on the run since last year.
They had been arrested in connection with a series of violent robberies in major towns in Kirinyaga and locked up at Sagana Police Station.

In one of the robberies, they took away gun from a police officer but it was later recovered.
They escaped unnoticed from the station and had been in hiding until Sunday when they were found.
According to Kirinyaga West Deputy County Commissioner Moses Ivuto, police acted on a tipoff.
Mr Ivuto said two more remand prisoners are still at large and are being sought.
Mr Ivuto described the suspects as dangerous criminals who had been terrorising traders and residents.
"They used to rob M-pesa money transfer agents and other business people from the area. Residents were also not spared," he said.





He said the suspects are being questioned and will soon be charged in court. Eleven warders have been arrested in connection with the escape of eight death row inmates at Naivasha Maximum Security Prison. Mr Sawe said prison wardens saw the inmate escape and pursued him. Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor gives his report on the nature of injuries suffered following post-mortem exams. His presidential campaign team says he will conduct radio and TV interviews to persuade voters to turn up in big numbers. Ugandan government officials are accused of seeking to manipulate public debate ahead of the elections.
