President Uhuru Kenyatta has extended the night curfew to March 12, Interior CS Dr Fred Matiang’i has said during the schools’ reopening press briefing.
The nationwide curfew will continue to be enforced between 10pm and 4am daily, the president said in an Executive Order signed on Sunday morning.
The Order also extends other Covid-19 containment measures, the CS said.

At the same time, Education CS Prof George Magoha said the government will provide three million needy learners with masks as schools reopen Monday.
He requested parents who can afford to buy at least two facemasks for their children.
Done everything possible
“I want to affirm very strongly that the government has done everything possible to ensure schools will open tomorrow,” he said.
The CS, however, confessed that it will not be possible to achieve the required one-metre social distancing in classrooms.





He reiterated that schools should create space under trees, dining halls and any open space.
The CS, at the same time, told parents should not take advantage of the government’s guideline of school fees –that no learner should be sent home due to lack of school fees- and emphasised that parents will have to pay fees for schools to maintain their children.
Only needy learners will be exempted from fees payment, he said.
Prof Magoha also said the government has released Sh4 billion for free public primary schooling, which should get into their accounts on Monday or Tuesday.
He said secondary schools will get their Sh14.6 billion by Friday.
For his part, Transport CS Mr James Macharia announced the doubling of the inter-county trains on Monday to ease travel for learners.

} In most schools, lack of classrooms, desks, water, toilets, and dormitories is a stark reality. A new twist in the battle between DP Ruto and his political foe Gideon Moi, for control of vote-rich Rift Valley.
