Last week, some 200 elders from across Narok “endorsed” Devolution Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli for the seat.
The PS said he has learnt a lot on managing county governments.

“I will talk about this broadly when the right time comes,” he said.
His brother Andrew also wants to succeed Governor Samuel Tunai, with his supporters dismissing the endorsement of the PS by elders.
Supporters of Andrew, a Nairobi-based businessman, termed the endorsement premature. They added that an announcement would be made at the end of this month.
Mr Douglas Sunkuli, a representative of the larger Sunkuli family, said elders have held meetings to discuss the Tunai succession since last year, with a major one expected on January 29.

});
}, 62000);
}



He said it is premature for the team allied to the PS to make the endorsement announcement.
“We were shocked by the purported elder’s pronouncement. We will make the official announcement on January 29. Any other proclamation will be misleading Narok residents,” Douglas said.
Endorsement ceremony
Douglas, a cousin of the three Sunkuli brothers, said the announcement went against the family’s agreement in which Andrew is being fronted for the governor position while the PS is expected to contest the Kilgoris parliamentary seat.
“The family agreed that Charles should continue working in the government,” he said.
He also faulted the endorsement ceremony, which took place late in the evening.

“There was no representative from the family,” he said.
Andrew and his elder brother Julius contested the 2013 Narok Senate seat but lost to Mr Stephen ole Ntutu.
Julius was Internal Security Minister in the 1990s when Daniel Toroitich arap Moi was the country’s president. 
He was Kilgoris MP between 1997-2002 and is seeking the same position in 2022.
Douglas said Andrew performed well during the Narok Senate contest and established networks to be used in the governor bid.
The PS hosted elders at his Olpisiyai home in Trans Mara West on Saturday. 
According to the elders, the PS has experience in management, having served in several ministries at national level.  The former Nairobi governor also explains why he did not file an election petition.
