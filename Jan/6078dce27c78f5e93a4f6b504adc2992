Media reports in Qatar indicated Reysol had accepted an offer worth Sh806 million from Al Duhail in exchange for the former Gor Mahia and Tusker striker. 

All that now remains is for the Upper Hill High School old boy to negotiate personal terms. 

He is said to have asked for a 100 per cent increase to his Sh85 million annual salary at Reysol.

“I haven’t talked to him (Olunga) but heard he has another good offer from Qatar. I encourage him to pick up these offers because he is (almost) 27 and not 22. He has about four or five years remaining at the top level. It is time for him to make good money,” said Oliech, in an exclusive interview.

Oliech however warns Olunga that it is not all rosy in the Gulf. 

“He will have to get a strong agent and negotiate a good contract. When I was there, most club owners would delay the salary of  a player when his performance dipped. There wasn’t much of world class management. 

“It is also very hot over there and he will have to adapt fast.” 

Oliech would know a lot about conditions in Qatar. 

Considered one of the greatest Kenyan strikers to put on a Harambee Stars jersey, Oliech, 35, enjoyed a successful stint in that country, with top tier side Al Arabi, between 2003 and 2005 before moving to France.

At Arabi, he played alongside Argentinian great Gabriel Batistuta and Nigerian defender Taribo West. 

So impressive was Oliech’s at the time that he was offered Qatari citizenship with a Sh200 million inducement that he famously declined. 

Al Duhail’s interest in Olunga comes at a time the Kenyan striker is in top form. 

He scored 55 times in two seasons at Reysol and was named both top scorer and Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the just concluded J1 League.

By the weekend Reysol had not given any word on the status of the Kenyan hitman. 

The Japanese club has however announced a flurry of departures and arrivals. 

They include that of Kenta Matsumuto who's returned to the club following a spell at Omiya Ardija while goalkeeper Kazushige Kirihata has extended his stay at the club for another year. 

Olunga moved to Reysol in August 2018 from Chinese side GZ Hengfeng. He also had a half season loan spell at La Liga side then Girona in 2018 

Al Duhail are said to be eyeing Olunga as a replacement to former Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic who has failed to sparkle in the Middle East. Olunga has been on the radar of the Qatari side for months. Top Qatari side Al Duhail SC has bid Sh1 billion in exchange for the Harambee Stars forward. Experts say authorities may have destroyed or scrubbed away crucial evidence in a panicked initial response. The man who holds a Nigerian passport was on Friday night arrested in connection with a gruesome killing in Syokimau. Stephen Thuku was reportedly blocked by another car at Nairobi’s Githurai Mwihoko area by three armed men.
