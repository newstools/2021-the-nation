President Museveni also asked Ugandans to maintain peace during the vote counting process. There are 11 candidates seeking to oust President Yoweri Museveni who have been in power for the last 35 years. For Uganda's 76-year-old revolutionary president, the harvest is still not over. Reports show that the ballot box was stolen after the truck that was hired to deliver voting materials broke down. The new fuel prices will be in force from Friday, January 15, to Sunday, February 14.
