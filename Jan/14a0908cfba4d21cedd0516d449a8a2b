The Supreme Council of Kenyan Muslims (Supkem) has welcomed the signing of an agreement that ended the blockade and boycott of Qatar by five of its neighbours, effectively ending the four-year gulf crisis.
Saudi Arabia and its regional allies reached a breakthrough agreement with Qatar on Tuesday not only ending the impasse but also restoring ties between the Arabian Gulf neighbours.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in 2017, imposing a blockade that separated families and businesses and shattered Gulf unity. Pointing to Qatar’s close relations with Iran, the four countries accused Qatar of supporting extremist groups in the region and violating a 2014 agreement with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), of which it is a member.
In their statement, Supkem said both the blockade and boycott had escalated political and security challenges in the region, which have had an adverse effect on international security and commerce.
Mr ole Naado called on the citizens of the region to support the deal and embrace each other in the spirit of brotherhood.
