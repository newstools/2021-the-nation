Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru has said that her administration is on course in delivering her 2017 election pledges as her major flagship projects are nearing completion.
Addressing the faithful of St. Thomas ACK Church, Kerugoya on Sunday, the governor cited some of the life changing projects that her administration has implemented in the three years that she has been in office.

Ms Waiguru said that Kerugoya is considered as the capital of Kirinyaga County and, therefore, many of the development projects that have been implemented there are geared towards raising its standards to that of a city.
Modern medical complex
She said that that one of her flagship projects is the upgrading of Kerugoya County Hospital from a level four to a level five hospital. This, she said, is about to be achieved through building of a five-storey modern medical complex at the hospital which is expected to be completed by July.





The governor said that upon completion, the hospital will have a fully equipped intensive care unit (ICU) and a high dependency unit (HDU) with a capacity of at least 15 beds, among other amenities available in high-end medical facilities.
“This will enable us offer the required medical services to our residents and we will no longer have to refer them for services to the neighbouring counties such as Embu and Nyeri.
Wellness city
In Kirinyaga’s development blue print that is dubbed the “The Mountain Cities”, Kirinyaga Central Constituency,  in which Kerogoya Hospital lies, has been captured as the county’s ‘Wellness City’, in which residents can access the highest level of healthcare services.

Governor Waiguru thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration for supporting the county’s health sector.
She said that the money given for Covid-19 management has been used to accelerate the completion of the medical complex in which one wing will be set aside as an isolation centre.
“Instead of putting up temporary isolation centres such as tents, we decided to invest in a more comprehensive and sustainable arrangement that includes equipping of the new upcoming hospital. We already have 300 beds and ventilator machines ready for the complex,” said the governor.
She added that the hospital will be a game changer as it will raise the level of medical services offered in the county.
Ms Waiguru said the medical complex will also have a special mother’s unit which will enhance maternal and childcare services in the county.
Attract investors
The governor also said that the ongoing facelift projects in Kerugoya town which include the building of modern car parks, pedestrian walkways and cabro paving of streets and beautification projects are meant to provide a conducive environment to the town’s residents and traders and attract investors.
At the same time, the governor said that through Wezesha Kirinyaga economic empowerment programme, her administration has implemented life-changing projects which are leading to improved livelihoods among residents by improving their agricultural productivity.

She noted that her administration will use Sh300 million to build value addition factories which include an avocado pack house and a tomato processing factory.
The tomato factory, she said, will save farmers from losses that they incur whenever there is excess production.
She said Kirinyaga is the leading tomato producer with an annual production of about 50,000 tons.
She added that the avocado pack house will enable farmers to process their produce for export market.
The governor reiterated her administration’s commitment in ensuring equitable development in all the parts of the county.
