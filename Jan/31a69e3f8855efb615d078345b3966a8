“The children are stable and out of danger now. Only four had broken limbs while the others suffered scratches. They will be discharged after counselling,” Dr Wahome said.
According to Meru Base Commander Peter Wambua, the bus, which had 51 pupils and one teacher, overturned at a sharp bend.
“The driver was unable to negotiate a sharp bend before the vehicle overturned on the left side. We urge drivers to be cautious on the road and ensure they adhere to all traffic rules,” Mr Wambua said.
