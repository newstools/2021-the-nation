An archbishop in Uganda has cautioned both citizens and security agents against provoking one another, saying it is costing lives besides creating more disunity in the country ahead of the forthcoming elections.
“Don’t provoke one another, whether those of other parties or security. Let us promote peace and harmony in our country,” Gulu Archbishop John Baptist Odama said to his congregation on New Year’s day at St Joseph’s Cathedral in Gulu City.

});
}, 62000);
}



The archbishop said provocation has resulted in the loss of lives, which is uncalled for.
“We must put it into our hearts and minds that the care of one another as Ugandans must take priority, no matter the positions you have or jobs or political parties and religious groups you belong to. Let us start the year together up to the end…,” Archbishop Odama said.

The cleric also cautioned the Electoral Commission (EC) of Uganda as the January 14 vote approaches.
Free, fair and successful
“As it is the desire of all Ugandans, elections should be peacefully done, free, fair and successful. So, we must go as Ugandans with one voice. We want our country to remain loyal to God and we love one another,” he said.
He added: “Therefore, I appeal to the EC to make sure they are transparent and fair. Those who have arms in their hands, don’t use them to kill. You have alternatives to arrest those who go against the law but not killing (them).”
Similarly, religious leaders in Acholi Sub-region under their umbrella Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative, led by their chairperson Bishop Nelson Onono Onweng, have expressed their disappointment with the police over their brutality meted out against Opposition leaders and journalists as the country heads to the polls.

Speaking to journalists in their offices in Koro, Omoro District on Thursday, Bishop Onweng cited the brutality the police meted out against Forum for Democratic Change party presidential candidate Patrick Oboi Amuriat and the National Unity Platform’s Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, while on the campaign trail.
“We call upon the Uganda Police Force and its sister forces to enforce the law and order on Opposition leaders with dignity and respect. We condemn in the strongest terms the police brutality on civilians and the frequent use of tear gas, pepper spray, rubber and live bullets while dispersing the crowds of Opposition leaders,” Bishop Onweng said.
He also urged presidential candidates to observe the anti-Covid-19 Standard Operating Procedures. The official Twitter account of the singer-turned-politician also announced the arrest. NTV’s Ali Mivule narrates how he and his colleagues were shot while covering Bobi Wine’s campaign. Pope Francis has accepted his resignation, which came after he attained the mandatory retirement age. Nyeri Town MP Mr Ngunjiri Wambugu said Mr Kang’ata was not sincere in his letter for sharing it with the media and the public. Learning institutions were shut in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
