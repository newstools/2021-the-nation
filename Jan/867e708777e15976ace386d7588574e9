Suspected al-Shabaab militants have bombed a telecommunications mast in Banisa Sub-County, Mandera County three days after they attacked a bus and a private vehicle in the same area.
Local residents who spoke to the Nation said the militants used explosives to destroy the mast at Darkale center on Tuesday night.

“We are in distress and we don't know who will save us. The militants are here creating havoc and fear. They bombed the Safaricom mast at night and that has weakened the communication network,” said Hassan Ahmed.
He said the destroyed mast had been serving about ten other sub-stations.
On Monday, a roadside planted the suspected al-Shabaab militants exploded, partially damaging a private vehicle transporting examination material to Mandera.
Three of the vehicle's occupants are yet to be found.





A few hours later, a bus heading to Nairobi was shot at by the same group but the driver sped off and the police on escort engaged the group in a shootout.
On Tuesday, Edward Ibwaka, the Banisa sub-county police commander, said air and foot patrols had been launched in search of the missing three.
“We were told police and the military were combing our area for the militants but it is surprising that in less than a day, a mast has been damaged,” said Mr Ahmed.
Security agencies in Banisa could not be reached for comment.
