Majority Chief Whip Wangari Methu said the death has shocked the entire assembly as it came unexpectedly.
"We are shocked by the death of our colleague whose condition had appeared to be improving. Members have severally visited him in and out of the hospital since he fell sick. He was among the active and focused leaders in the House," said Ms Methu.
News of the death were broken by acting Speaker Zachary Njeru during a special sitting convened to communicate the gazettement of the ouster of former Speaker Wahome Ndegwa.

We wish to comfort his family, relatives and the people of Rurii during this difficult moment. I also adjourn the House for two weeks to allow the mourning of the deceased," said the acting Speaker.
Governor Francis Kimemia and embattled Speaker Ndegwa were among leaders who sent the condolence messages to the family and relatives of Mr Githinji.
