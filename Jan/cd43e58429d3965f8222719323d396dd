He confirmed that the students were involved in a head-on-collision with a bus coming from Siaya.
However, he could not confirm what might have exactly transpired before the collision and that they were still investigating.
"The accident happened around 7:30am on Saturday. Nobody in the bus got injured. The bus is at Siaya Police station at the moment," he said.
Nation Sport has established that three of the deceased were students at Wager Secondary school in Siaya County and one from a neighboring primary school.





Their motorcycle is said to have been involved in an accident with an Eldoret Express bus, which crashed them at Sigana in Alego Usonga, along the Kisumu-Luanda-Siaya road.
According to a statement from Athletics Kenya Nyanza North Chairman, Mr Joseph Ochieng, the quartet- Vincent Ouma Oguda, Victor Otieno Okumu, Victor Ochieng Tuju and Samuel Oduor Nyapola never made it to the competitions.
“Unfortunately, they got an accident, head-on with a bus and all the four died on the spot. This is bad for Nyanza North, bad for Athletics Kenya, bad for all the athletes as a whole. We lost very promising young athletes,” said Mr Ochieng.
