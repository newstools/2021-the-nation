The Chief Magistrate’s Court in Masaka, Uganda Monday granted bail to majority of National Unity Platform (NUP) members and private guards of presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, who were arrested in Kalangala District last week.
A total of 126 suspects appeared before both Masaka Chief Magistrate Charles Yeteisi and Grade One Magistrate Grace Wakholi at different intervals in two separate court rooms. The court administration indicated that this was to cut time and the bulk of work for one court official.

Among the suspects is Bobi Wine’s singing partner, Ali Bukeni alias Nubian Li and Mr Eddy Ssebufu aka Eddie Mutwe (Bobi Wine’s private guard).
Yeteisi heard that Eddie Mutwe , Nubian Li and  others  on  December 31 ,2020 in Kibale Village, Buyoga Sub-County, Kalangala District incited  violence and also did a negligent act likely to spread an infectious disease .

However, the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The defence lawyers led by Majeran Kazibwe asked the court to grant the suspects bail since they have spent over five days in police custody and many had been tortured.
Torture claims
The presiding magistrate then asked the accused persons to prove to court the allegations of torture and several displayed physical injuries on their bodies. Some of them were seen limping in court.
The State prosecutor did not object to the bail application but asked the court to set stringent conditions before granting them bond.
“I have heard the submissions of the defence lawyers and I have examined the sureties of some of the accused persons and they are not substantial. However, it is in the observation of this court that some of the suspects were tortured while in cells and ought to be granted bail,” Mr Yeteisi.

Mr Yeteise granted majority of the suspects a cash bail of USh100,000 and each of the sureties were bonded USh5 million non-cash.
No substantial sureties
Some of the suspects failed to secure court bail because of lack of substantial sureties and additional charges slapped against them.
Eddie Mutwe, Stanley Kafuko, Hassan Katumba and Lukeman Kampala who were slapped with additional six charges of malicious damage to property and assault of police officers on duty, among others, were also not given bail because the time for court sitting had elapsed. They were also remanded until January 19.
NUP lawyer Benjamin Katana told the Daily Monitor that time had caught up with them as they sought to finalise the paper work for those who had been granted bail.
“We shall have to go back tomorrow (Tuesday) and process the paperwork so that they can be released. [For] those who have not been granted bail, we shall apply for their production in court and then apply for bail afresh,” Mr Katana said Monday.
However, their joy was short lived as the bail money was paid late in the bank.
The case was adjourned until January 19, 2021 when the suspects are expected in court for further hearing.
