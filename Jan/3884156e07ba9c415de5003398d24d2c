 ‘Burning’ or ‘breaking’ bridges?
In the op-ed “Our politics is still hard to read” by Mutuma Mathiu (Daily Nation, Jan. 15, 2021), the 10th paragraph read as follows: “The Building Bridges Initiative — or ‘Breaking Bridges Initiative’ according to the electoral commission — is apparently the President’s most important political project.” It was a good read. Just a small note: It was said IEBC referred to BBI as “Burning”, not “Breaking”, Bridges Initiative.

Mind your grammar
Many of us like reading your newspapers. But may I bring to your attention some writing and editing errors repeated in the Daily Nation, The EastAfrican and Business Daily. The commonly misused words include avail, shambles and will.

Names, please
Today in History arouses a nostalgic past for those who witnessed the history. It will help if you give the names of all those in the picture. On January 19, somebody who looks like [Pio Gama] Pinto was not named. I don’t think I’m asking for too much.

Prime stories
I keep asking myself: What’s the point of having “Prime” stories in the online Nation? These items you cannot open and read without login. But if registration and login is free, why should a reader who has already registered still be unable to directly open the Prime stories?
