Mr Kadima, who was on January 9 arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over the lawyer's killing, is also wanted in South Africa over battery accusations.
It is still not clear how he left the country and made his way into Kenya, where he worked at a local gym. He currently holds a Nigerian passport.
Ms Musyoki, the founder of Koki & Associates, was found in her bedroom inside her house in Syokimau, Machakos County, where, according to the police, the two lived together for a year.





Police said that the suspect left the house on Thursday night only for the body to be discovered on Friday morning by the house help, who got concerned after realising that she had taken too long to wake up.
According to the house help, when she checked on her, she stumbled on her lifeless body.
Detectives believe that Kadima fled the house after committing the crime.
The case will be mentioned on January 25 for plea and further orders. The man who holds a Nigerian passport was on Friday night arrested in connection with a gruesome killing in Syokimau.
