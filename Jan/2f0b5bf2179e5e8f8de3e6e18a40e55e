Farmers in Mbeere North have benefited from 3,000 seedlings, with Evurore and Nthawa wards getting 1,500 seedlings each.In Mbeere South, 1,400 seedlings were distributed in Mbeti South and Mavuria wards, which received 700 seedlings each. The Embu county government has distributed more than 5,000 cashewnut seedlings to farmers across the county.
The 5,400 seedlings were distributed to farmers in Mbeere South and North.
These areas had earlier been identified as having the potential for cashewnut production.
Other areas in Manyatta and Runyenjes were also identified as arable land for production of the highly nutritious crop.

This comes after the countyâ€™s Department of Agriculture conducted research on which other crops can do well in different areas within Embu.
While launching the distribution, Embu County Executive Committee member (CEC) for Agriculture, Mr Jamleck Muturi, said that agriculture extension officers will be moving round training farmers on how to nurture the seedlings.
Mr Muturi said the county will ensure that Embu farmers practise modern and diversified agriculture.

"Even as this is set to improve nutrition, cashewnuts are in high demand in the market. A kilo goes for Sh1,000 and this will truly boost farmers' earnings," said Mr Muturi.
Improving agriculture
Farmers in Mbeere North have benefited from 3,000 seedlings, with Evurore and Nthawa wards getting 1,500 seedlings each.
In Mbeere South, 1,400 seedlings were distributed in Mbeti South and Mavuria wards, which received 700 seedlings each.
Manyatta and Runyenjes took 1,000 seedlings with Kithimu, Mbeti North, Kagaari South and Kyeni South wards getting a share of 250 seedlings each.
Embu Governor Martin Wambora has been in the forefront in improving agriculture in the county.
His government has been sourcing a market for farmers' produce to enable them improve their livelihoods.

Just a week ago, the county government distributed 66,000 fingerlings to farmers' groups with the aim of improving aquaculture in the region.
In October, the government announced measures to revive the cashew nut industry in Kenya.
Principal Secretary for Agriculture Hamadi Boga said the government aims to increase production to more than 200,000 tonnes annually.
Currently, Kenya's cashewnut production stands at a meagre 5,000 tonnes annually.
This follows years of decline in yields due to inappropriate agricultural methods, lack of market, ageing trees and poor regulatory policies. New initiative vows to ensure that once source of livelihood for hundreds of thousands at the Coast, is brought back to former glory. The government sees Bt cotton as part of the route for its industrialisation agenda. The former Nairobi governor also explains why he did not file an election petition. The university student is now the prime suspect in the multiple homicides his parents, brother, cousin and his father's worker. Tough-talking President Kenyatta tells off his critics, saying he is fully in charge of the country.
