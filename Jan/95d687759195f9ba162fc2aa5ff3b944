Mr Abdulahi Diriye, a member of the party’s NEB, presided over the event in Kisii town. Mr Oparanya, who was flanked by ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed, Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen among other party and elected leaders from Western Kenya said they will employ door-to-door campaign strategy to ensure they win the seats.

“Due to the stringent measures and the ban on political gatherings by the President because of Covid-19, we shall go down to the villages and campaign for our candidates, and we are confident we shall win,” Mr Oparanya said.
He said Mr Were having served in Matungu for a record 15 years was experienced to complete the development projects he initiated and those started by the late area MP Justus Murunga.
Mr Junet said the campaigns in Matungu will be under the supervision and command of Mr Oparanya, the Kakamega Governor. “He will be in charge of the campaigns and we will work under his command,” Mr Junet said
Mr Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC) had hoped that ODM would back its candidate r Peter Nabulindo in the spirit of the Nasa Coalition but the ODM move to clear Mr Were has dashed those hopes.

ANC deputy leader Ayub Savula had told the Nation that they were in talks with ODM to back their candidate for the seat. But Mr Junet said ODM is a national party and urged their opponents to stop the blame game.
“Nobody should question why we are fielding candidates. This is a party in Kenya and not in Tanzania and as such has a right to participate in any election.” For Uhuru, Raila, Ruto, Kalonzo, Mudavadi and Wetang’ula, outcome of mini polls a pointer to referendum, 2022 The survival of Jubilee Party is threatened by the falling-out between allies of the President and his deputy, Dr William Ruto Boarding schools are melting pots where thousands of learners from all over the country converged this week.
