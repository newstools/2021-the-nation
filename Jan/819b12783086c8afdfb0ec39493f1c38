The team has been training for the past three weeks under the watchful eyes of assistant coach Sadat Gaya with head coach Cliff Owuor still held up in Rwanda where he is coach of Rwanda Patriotic Army (APR) men's team. 

“I'm very happy to be here as part of the Moran's technical bench. I really enjoyed my first training session which was full of intensity  as we went through several drills before we finally had a scrimmage,” she said. 






According to Mills, she has been following Kenyan basketball since 2010 when she first visited Kenya and is very happy that the game has grown tremendously  in the past five years. 

“Basketball is my passion and I believe it’s not all about the wins and losses but developing the character of players before the results can follow,” said Mills who has been particularly passionate about developing the game in Africa and using it as a tool to promote not only health but character development.

Mills began her coaching career in her native Australia but has predominantly coached in Africa since 2011 handling senior men's clubs, men's university teams and men's senior national teams. 

Kenya Basketball Federation treasurer Peter Orero while welcoming Mills to the country said the federation found it necessary  to expand the team's technical bench especially now that the level of the competition is higher and predicted an improved performance for the team.

“With head coach Cliff Owuor who is held up in Kigali expected anytime from today, and Sadat Gaya who has been doing a wonderful job with the team for the past three weeks, we believe the addition of Mills will make the technical bench very rich in ideas,“ Orero said. 

Mills, who became the first woman to coach a men's national team in Africa when she handled the Zambia men's national team as an assistant coach, has also been an assistant coach for the Cameroon national team apart from coaching in Namibia and South Africa. 

Her last assignment in Africa was in 2019 when she was head coach of Patriots of Rwanda guiding them to the group stages of Africa Basketball League. The three top teams in the group will qualify for continental finals that will be hosted by Rwanda in August. Bears have crushed all their opponents in the 10-team league except Randers.
