Two police officers are in custody in Mombasa County for allegedly extorting Sh106,000 from a foreigner.
Tabitha Nduta and Patrick Muneria, both from the Tourist Police Unit in Bamburi, are accused of obtaining the money from Mr Werner Bance by threatening to arrest him.
According to a police report seen by the Nation, a woman called the officers after Mr Bance rejected her sexual advances, saying he was married to another Kenyan woman.

Investigation launched
Mr Bance pleaded with the officers to let him go and said he could only raise 800 euros (Sh106, 000), which he requested to go and collect from the hotel where he was staying.
“The two people took a taxi to Indiana (hotel), snatched his phone upon arriving and instructed him to go and collect the money,” the report states.
Mr Bance came back with the money and gave it to the officers, who then returned his phone.
