DCI coach Daniel Bor concedes Wekesa's absence is a big blow to the team but said he has enough cover.
"Her absence will definitely be felt but the development will also give other players an opportunity to show their worth. With one week remaining to the league serve off, we are doing our final touches in every department and so far so good. 
"Our aspiration remains to be in the top four at the completion of the regular season so as to book a place in the play-offs. While we finished last during the 2019 play-offs, this time round we are determined to be in the medal bracket that will see us qualify for the African Clubs Championship," said Bor.





Kenya Prisons retained the title as KCB Women's Volleyball Team and Kenya Pipeline finished in the second and third positions respectively.
In the absence of Wekesa, the team will rely on Marion Indeche and Mercy Iminza.
Bor also welcomed the return of libero Josephine Wafula who was out with a nagging knee injury last season. Wafula will partner with upcoming libero Joy Wangaya in the reception department.

With the team contributing one player - middle blocker Carolyne Sirengo to the national women's team ahead of Tokyo Olympics - Bor has challenged other players to step up their game and earn a call up.

"It's a motivation to other players and to the technical bench as well. We are happy and we wish her well. We hope to contribute more players to the team in future assignments," said Bor.

DCI will launch their title campaign against star-studded KCB before they battle Kenya Army in their other match.
