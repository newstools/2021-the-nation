Bears, who had again used their home advantage to stun Italians Dinamo Sassari 93-71 last month, were inspired by American QJ Peterson who scored a game-high 35 points, seven rebounds and five assists.

Steffen Wich’s men started the must-win return match strongly. They had lost all their first leg matches against Spanish side Iberostar Tenerife 98-73 in October and Galatasaray 91-81, Sassari 91-84 in November last year.
Kenyan international small forward Ongwae got the Bears off to a nice start after scoring a two-pointer and a lay-up for 4-0.
After the promising start, Peterson scored a couple of three-pointers before and after another two points from Ongwae for a lead of 12-6.

This offensive thirst managed to split Galatasaray’s defence throughout the period with Bears leading 29-20 in the first quarter. 
The Bears again started the second quarter brightly with dominant rebound play, stifling defence and an inspired attack which complemented each other, to make Galatasaray several times look completely bewildered in their own half. 
Ryan Evans was on the scoresheet several times as Peterson kept counting three-pointers to open a 16-point lead at 36-20.
After an attacking sequence, the home team managed to widen the gap to 39-23 through Adama Darboe.
Galatasaray began regrouping its troops but only for a while as Bears continued to dominate both offensively and defensively. With contributions from American DeShawn Stephens and Peterson in particular, Bears enjoyed a lead of 58-39 at half-time.

In the third period, however, the Bears showed a little less fervour than in the first two periods. Although the pace remained high, Galatasaray slowly started to find more success in their attacking play as the Bears cooled off a bit.
At one moment, when Peterson rested in the middle of the third quarter, Galatasaray scored three times in a row without any response from the Bears.
However, Peterson returned to the court to give the Bears a much-needed three-pointer for 69-51 score.
Darboe coolly converted the last shot of the period with a clean three to take the scores to 72-55 after three more points from Galatasaray.
Despite the last period of the match starting with a point from the Bears, Galatasaray's defence showed a little more teeth than before. The Bears had a long run without scoring, which resulted in their lead being cut down to 75-61 and later on to 12 points at 80-68.
Wich’s men continued to work hard and it paid off as a three-pointer each from Peterson and Ongwae got them more breathing space at 86-68.
Then, Peterson added a spectacular putback dunk which snuffed out the fighting spirit from the visitors.
Sassari leads the group with seven points from four matches. Tenerife is second with a similar number of points and matches. The Bears and Galatasaray are on seven and six points respectively after playing five matches apiece.

Bears have to beat Tenerife in their last group match on January 20 at Aarhus Arena to boost their chances of advancing to the play-offs.  Senior specialists among those affected. Kenya has secured its first 24 million doses of the vaccine through Covax. Keen to expand his support base, Dr Ruto, backed by his allies, has gone full-blown to challenge his main political opponents.
