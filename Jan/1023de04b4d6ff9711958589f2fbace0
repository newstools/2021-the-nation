The death last Sunday of popular one-man guitarist Mighty Salim (real name Timothy Njuguna) at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi has brought down the curtain of one of the greatest stars of the ‘Mugithi’ song and dance genre.
Salim, who was a key member of the famed Salim musical family from Subukia in Nakuru County, succumbed to a long battle with a kidney illness.

His siblings – Sarafina Salim, Naomi Salim and Salim Young – broke the news of the death through social media posts. Since then, there has been an outpouring of grief from fans across the country.
In an emotional post on Sunday night, Sarafina, who is also musician, said: "There are no goodbyes for us. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart. Rest in peace. Rest well my brother Njuguna, ” she said.
The death was a tragic coincidence, coming just a day after he was involved in putting together a tribute celebration to mark the fifth death anniversary of his elder brother, Salim Junior (Paul Mwangi).





Salim Junior introduced his younger brothers, Mighty and Young, to the popular "Mugithi" one-man guitar style that rocked the country’s airwaves on the many TV and FM radio stations and enjoyed club play in the late 1990s.
Selfless efforts
Speaking to the Nation yesterday, fellow Mugithi one-man guitar wizard Mike Rua eulogised Mighty Salim for his selfless and sterling efforts in music.
"He often got in touch on musical matters like last Saturday during the marking of the fifth anniversary of his brother's death," Rua said.
He said artistes would be holding meetings at the Blue Springs Hotel on Thika Superhighway in Nairobi to raise funds for funeral arrangements.

Gospel musician Purity Gitonga joined other artistes in sharing Mighty Salim’s songs on social media to mourn his death.
His most popular songs include Koma Thayu, Jira Dukadiga and Ihoya Riakwa.
Mighty Salim made his debut in Mugithi circles in Nairobi in 1998 through the encouragement of his brother Salim Junior, who was member of the legendary Queen Jane's QueenJa Les Les Band before going solo.
In an emotional post on social media a few years ago, Mighty Salim sent an appeal to his fans to help him raise funds for his treatment.
