Bisaka was the founder and leader of the Faith of Unity movement.
A joint statement by Bisaka’s son Omukwenda Mitooro and Omukwenda Mugisa, on behalf of the Faith of Unity advisory council, said, “We announce the passing on of the body [sic] of Omukama Ruhanga Owobusobozi Bisaka, founder of the Faith of Unity of all people.
The statement released on Saturday said other preparations will be announced later.
It followed over two weeks of speculation about his death on social media, with the government and the movement remaining silent.





Official burial
After the confirmation, the government said it will accord Bisaka an official burial.
The Daily Monitor has learnt that senior government officials led by Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda met with Bisaka’s family and other leaders in Kampala on Friday to discuss funeral plans.
Dr Rugunda reportedly assigned Public service minister David Karubanga the role of coordinating the plans.
Mr Karubanga, who is also the Kigorobya County MP in Hoima district, said President Yoweri Museveni gave directions for the official burial due to Bisaka's contributions towards the country's development.
“The President also said the arrangements should adhere to government guidelines for fighting Covid-19,” Mr Karubanga said.
