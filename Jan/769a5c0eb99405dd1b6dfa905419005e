Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's administration has implemented a raft of disciplinary measures against over 400 nurses who were on strike for ''absconding duty''.
The health workers have been locked out of their work stations and their names struck off the payroll.
In a statement by acting chief officer for health and sanitation Dr Gregory Ganda, nurses wishing to resume work have been asked to reapply to be readmitted.

The move by the local government further strains the rocky relationship health workers have had with the county.
Nurses in Kisumu downed their tools in protest on December 7.
Some of their demands include comprehensive health insurance, free treatment for Covid-19, improved risk allowances, personal protective equipment, promotions, designations, payment of arrears and creation of a national health service commission to deal with their employment.

Dr Ganda said the nurses had failed to return to work after the expiry of the seven-day notice issued to them by Governor Nyong’o. The county boss had earlier said that the nurses’ grievances and demands were already addressed and some salaries paid in November.
In his notice, Dr Ganda indicated that the nurses should return all government property in their possession.
“All officers in this list have been withdrawn from the payroll henceforth and those who erroneously received their December 2020 salaries, not having worked, shall have the same recovered,” said Dr Ganda.
He claimed that nurses have been making technical appearances, coming to work without uniform and not working.
Dr Ganda also directed that those who are willing to resume work must reapply to be re-admitted and show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for absconding duty.

“Show cause letters will be issued through respective sub-county medical officers of health starting on Wednesday and each person shall respond individually through their respective senior officers stated above,” said Dr Ganda.
All nurses on annual leave have also been recalled to work and those who will not report within 48 hours will face disciplinary action, the officer said.
