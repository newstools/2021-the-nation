A man accused of defiling and impregnating his two underage daughters was arrested Sunday by police in Kirinyaga County.
The man said to be a pastor was flushed out of his hideout in Mbeere South and taken to Sagana police station where he was locked up for questioning.
Kirinyaga West Deputy Commissioner Moses Ivuto said police tracked down the suspect from last December after the victim’s relatives reported the case.

"Police have finally managed to seize the suspect. He will soon be charged," he said, noting the seriousness of the offence. "He has ruined the lives of his school going children so we shall not spare him.”
Mr Ivuto warned that anyone found guilty of sexually abusing school girls will face the full force of the law.
"The government takes sexual offences seriously so offenders will not go unpunished," he said.

Reports indicate that one of the girls has given birth while the other has about three months to go. 
Relatives said the man warned the minors of dire consequences if they reported him.
"When the girls were heavily pregnant, their mothers demanded to know who was responsible. They pointed the finger at their father," one said.
The matter was reported to the police but the accused fled on learning that he was being sought for interrogation.
Furore
Recently, two woman representatives led a major demonstration demanding the arrest and prosecution of the accused.
Kirinyaga’s Wangui Ngirici and Uasin Gishu’s Gladys Shollei said they would pile pressure on police until an arrest was made due to the gravity of the crime.
Tension mounted at Gathaka village where the offence was committed as demonstrators poured into the streets in protests to demand justice.

The MPs observed that the lives of the in primary school children were destroyed by the man whom they described as evil and dangerous.
"What the father has done to his daughters is unacceptable. The suspect should be apprehended and arraigned," Ms Ngirici said.
The lawmakers also noted that one of the victims dropped out of school after giving birth.
“It is sad that she has become a mother without completing her education. The father is a cruel man who is supposed to be languishing in jail by now," said Ms Shollei.
They added that defilement cases are on the rise in the region and asked police to protect children and punish the criminals. The pastor is reported to have lured the girl to his bedroom where he allegedly defiled.
