At best, the path ahead will be bumpy, with progress toward a return to travel dependent on the pace of vaccine roll-outs.Still, there will be leaps, including the first commercial flights to near-space. The nightmare year of 2020 brought the airline industry's first decade of sustained profitability to a shuddering halt. The coronavirus pandemic tore through in a tumultuous, unprecedented way — leaving carriers in a deep hole, along with a constellation of aerospace manufacturers, airports and leasing firms.

The New Year is shaping up to be a transition period for an enterprise that takes passengers on the equivalent of 208 million annual trips around the globe.
At best, the path ahead will be bumpy, with progress toward a return to travel dependent on the pace of vaccine roll-outs, access to capital, government policies and the unpredictability of a virus that's not yet fully understood.
Still, there will be leaps, including the first commercial flights to near-space.
Here are some developments to look for over the next 12 months.

• Fare wars: Airline traffic won't see a major boost until vaccines saturate populations enough to stamp down infection rates. Even then, it may take effort to get some people back on planes.
In Europe, that'll mean fares as low as 9.99 euros ($12.33), according to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. The Irish discounter on Thursday slashed its schedule through March, underscoring the uncertainties still clouding the industry outlook.
Other ideas being floated to entice travellers are free hotel stays, two-for-one deals and complimentary travel insurance. 
Lucrative business traffic
An upturn in leisure and family travel should hit most regions by around midyear. More lucrative business traffic is likely to trail as companies resist sending people out on the road.

John Grant, chief analyst at flight-bookings specialist OAG, says it won't be a recovery until enticements are no longer needed and carriers can manage routes for profit.
• Cash quest: Airlines raised record amounts of money in 2020. More will be required in 2021.Stock sales and debt conversions will take on a greater importance as companies try to restore balance sheets to health.
Governments, which ponied up $220 billion in state aid last year according to Moody's, will continue to play a role. 
• Brave new world: Just as long security lines, removing your shoes and limits on liquids have colored the post 9/11 experience of air travel, Covid is likely to herald continued use of masks, social distancing and apps for passenger records.
“When we look back on this in five or 10 years, it’s going to be a catalyst for many changes,” says John Strickland of airline advisory firm JLS Consulting. Customers are likely to demand airlines maintain their current high levels of hygiene, which could impact profitability. 
One major change that’s becoming part of the landscape is the introduction of pre-departure covid tests. Carriers had pushed for the step as a way to encourage travel, but had little success until the detection of a new strain of the virus in Britain forced governments into a rethink.
