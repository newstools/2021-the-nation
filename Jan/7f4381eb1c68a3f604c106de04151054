The Salaries and Remunerations Commission (SRC) recommended Sh124,800 as the ceiling for the MCAs’ monthly allowance.
The lawmakers rely heavily on sitting and travel allowances. However, the analysis notes, many county assemblies were adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Travel restrictions were imposed and some assembly premises were closed temporarily to curb the spread of the virus.
In Nyeri, however, sittings were held uninterrupted throughout the pandemic especially after teleconferencing was introduced in the chambers to minimise personal interactions.
